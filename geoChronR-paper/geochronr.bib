@article{Marcott_Science2013,
	Abstract = {Surface temperature reconstructions of the past 1500 years suggest that recent warming is unprecedented in that time. Here we provide a broader perspective by reconstructing regional and global temperature anomalies for the past 11,300 years from 73 globally distributed records. Early Holocene (10,000 to 5000 years ago) warmth is followed by ~0.7$\,^{\circ}$C cooling through the middle to late Holocene (<5000 years ago), culminating in the coolest temperatures of the Holocene during the Little Ice Age, about 200 years ago. This cooling is largely associated with ~2$\,^{\circ}$C change in the North Atlantic. Current global temperatures of the past decade have not yet exceeded peak interglacial values but are warmer than during ~75% of the Holocene temperature history. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change model projections for 2100 exceed the full distribution of Holocene temperature under all plausible greenhouse gas emission scenarios.},

	Abstract = {The hydrological cycle and its response to environmental variability such as temperature changes is of prime importance for climate reconstruction and prediction. We retrieved deuterated water/water (HDO/H2O) abundances using spaceborne absorption spectroscopy, providing an almost global perspective on the near-surface distribution of water vapor isotopologs. We observed an unexpectedly high HDO/H2O seasonality in the inner Sahel region, pointing to a strong isotopic depletion in the subsiding branch of the Hadley circulation and its misrepresentation in general circulation models. An extension of the analysis at high latitudes using ground-based observations of deltaD and a model study shows that dynamic processes can entirely compensate for temperature effects on the isotopic composition of precipitation.},

@article{Reimer09,
	Abstract = {The IntCal04 and Marine04 radiocarbon calibration curves have been updated from 12 cal kBP (cal kBP is here defined as thousands of calibrated years before AD 1950), and extended to 50 cal kBP, utilizing newly available data sets that meet the IntCal Working Group criteria for pristine corals and other carbonates and for quantification of uncertainty in both the 14C and calendar timescales as established in 2002. No change was made to the curves from 0-12 cal kBP. The curves were constructed using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation of the random walk model used for IntCal04 and Marine04. The new curves were ratified at the 20th International Radiocarbon Conference in June 2009 and are available in the Supplemental Material at www.radiocarbon.org.},

	Abstract = {{We extend the jackknife and the bootstrap method of estimating standard errors to the case where the observations form a general stationary sequence. We do not attempt a reduction to i.i.d. values. The jackknife calculates the sample variance of replicates of the statistic obtained by omitting each block of l consecutive data once. In the case of the arithmetic mean this is shown to be equivalent to a weighted covariance estimate of the spectral density of the observations at zero. Under appropriate conditions consistency is obtained if l = l(n) → ∞ and l(n)/n → 0. General statistics are approximated by an arithmetic mean. In regular cases this approximation determines the asymptotic behavior. Bootstrap replicates are constructed by selecting blocks of length l randomly with replacement among the blocks of observations. The procedures are illustrated by using the sunspot numbers and some simulated data.}},

	Abstract = {The summer of 2010 was exceptionally warm in eastern Europe and large parts of Russia. We provide evidence that the anomalous 2010 warmth that caused adverse impacts exceeded the amplitude and spatial extent of the previous hottest summer of 2003. ``Mega-heatwaves'' such as the 2003 and 2010 events likely broke the 500-year-long seasonal temperature records over approximately 50% of Europe. According to regional multi-model experiments, the probability of a summer experiencing mega-heatwaves will increase by a factor of 5 to 10 within the next 40 years. However, the magnitude of the 2010 event was so extreme that despite this increase, the likelihood of an analog over the same region remains fairly low until the second half of the 21st century.},

	Abstract = {The temperature history of the first millennium C.E. is sparsely documented, especially in the Arctic. We present a synthesis of decadally resolved proxy temperature records from poleward of 60$\,^{\circ}$N covering the past 2000 years, which indicates that a pervasive cooling in progress 2000 years ago continued through the Middle Ages and into the Little Ice Age. A 2000-year transient climate simulation with the Community Climate System Model shows the same temperature sensitivity to changes in insolation as does our proxy reconstruction, supporting the inference that this long-term trend was caused by the steady orbitally driven reduction in summer insolation. The cooling trend was reversed during the 20th century, with four of the five warmest decades of our 2000-year-long reconstruction occurring between 1950 and 2000.},

	Abstract = {{This book builds theoretical statistics from the first
      principles of probability theory. Starting from the basics
      of probability, the authors develop the theory of
      statistical inference using techniques, definitions, and
      concepts that are statistical and are natural extensions
      and consequences of previous concepts. Intended for
      first-year graduate students, this book can be used for
      students majoring in statistics who have a solid
      mathematics background. It can also be used in a way that
      stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory,
      being more concerned with understanding basic statistical
      concepts and deriving reasonable statistical procedures for
      a variety of situations, and less concerned with formal
      optimality investigations.}},

@article{Rodbell99,
	Abstract = {Debris flows have deposited inorganic laminae in an alpine lake that is 75 kilometers east of the Pacific Ocean, in Ecuador. These storm-induced events were dated by radiocarbon, and the age of laminae that are less than 200 years old matches the historic record of El Ni√$\pm$o events. From about 15,000 to about 7000 calendar years before the present, the periodicity of clastic deposition is greater than or equal to 15 years; thereafter, there is a progressive increase in frequency to periodicities of 2 to 8.5 years. This is the modern El Ni√$\pm$o periodicity, which was established about 5000 calendar years before the present. This may reflect the onset of a steeper zonal sea surface temperature gradient, which was driven by enhanced trade winds.},

	Abstract = {The Digital Earth {$[$}13{$]$} aims at developing a digital representation of the planet. It is motivated by the need for integrating and interlinking vast geo-referenced, multi-thematic, and multi-perspective knowledge archives that cut through domain boundaries. Complex scientific questions cannot be answered from within one domain alone but span over multiple scientific disciplines. For instance, studying disease dynamics for prediction and policy making requires data and models from a diverse body of science ranging from medical science and epidemiology over geography and economics to mining the social Web. The na{\"\i}ve assumption that such problems can simply be addressed by more data with a higher spatial, temporal, and thematic resolution fails as long as this more on data is not supported by more knowledge on how to combine and interpret the data. This makes semantic interoperability a core research topic of data-intensive science. While the Digital Earth vision includes processing services, it is, at its very core, a data archive and infrastructure. We propose to redefine the Digital Earth as a knowledge engine and discuss what the Semantic Web has to offer in this context and to Big Data in general.},

The speed at which any given scientific discipline advances will depend on how well its researchers collaborate with one another, and with technologists, in areas of eScience such as databases, workflow management, visualization, and cloud computing technologies.

In The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery, the collection of essays expands on the vision of pioneering computer scientist Jim Gray for a new, fourth paradigm of discovery based on data-intensive science and offers insights into how it can be fully realized.},

	Abstract = {El Ni√$\pm$o‚{\"A}{\`\i}Southern Oscillation (ENSO) powers global interannual climate variability through changes in trade wind strength, temperature and salinity anomalies, sea level, and atmospheric circulation patterns. ENSO variability is well characterized in modern times, but instrumental records cannot fully describe natural ENSO variability due to the imprint of anthropogenic climate forcing. ENSO activity may also be affected by solar variability, but the response of ENSO to such changes is difficult to predict. We constructed a continuous, monthly resolved, spliced fossil Porites coral {\OE}¥18O and Sr/Ca record from Misima Island, Papua New Guinea, in the Western Pacific Warm Pool, spanning 233 yr (1411‚{\"A}{\`\i}1644 CE [Common Era]). The Misima coral record indicates that the surface ocean in this region experienced a small change in hydrologic balance with no change in temperature, extended periods of quiescence in El Ni√$\pm$o activity, and no change in average amplitudes of El Ni√$\pm$o events relative to signals captured in regional modern records. The reduced El Ni√$\pm$o variability occurs during a known change in solar forcing, the initiation of the Little Ice Age. However, there is no clear relationship between the timing of changes in solar forcing and ENSO activity, implying that ENSO variability changes arise from internal dynamics. The century-scale switch between active and inactive El Ni√$\pm$o states has not previously been recorded, and provides a new baseline for climate models and reconstructions.},

	Abstract = {Currently a cosmic ray cloud connection (CRC) hypothesis is subject of an intense controversial debate. It postulates that galactic cosmic rays (GCR) intruding the Earth's atmosphere influence cloud cover. If correct it would have important consequences for our understanding of climate driving processes. Here we report on an alternative and stringent test of the CRC-hypothesis by searching for a possible influence of sudden GCR decreases (so-called Forbush decreases) on clouds. We find no response of global cloud cover to Forbush decreases at any altitude and latitude.},

	Abstract = {Svensmark et al. (2009) have recently claimed that strong galactic cosmic ray (GCR) decreases during \&{\#}8216;Forbush Decrease (FD) events\&{\#}8217; are followed by decreases in both the global liquid water cloud fraction (LCF) and other closely correlated atmospheric parameters. To test the validity of these findings we have concentrated on just one property, the MODIS LCF and examined two aspects: 1) The statistical chance that the decrease observed in the LCF is abnormal. 2) The likelihood of the observed delay (\&{\#}8764;5 to 9 days) being physically connected to the FD events. On both counts we conclude that LCF variations are unrelated to FD events: Both the pattern and timing of observed LCF changes are irreconcilable with current theoretical pathways. Additionally, a zonal analysis of LCF variations also offers no support to the claimed relationship, as the observed anomaly is not found to vary latitudinally in conjunction with cosmic ray intensity.},

@article{Krivova_GRL09,
	Abstract = {A gap in the total solar irradiance (TSI) measurements between ACRIM-1 and ACRIM-2 led to the ongoing debate on the presence or not of a secular trend between the minima preceding cycles 22 (in 1986) and 23 (1996). It was recently proposed to use the SATIRE model of solar irradiance variations to bridge this gap. When doing this, it is important to use the appropriate SATIRE-based reconstruction, which we do here, employing a reconstruction based on magnetograms. The accuracy of this model on months to years timescales is significantly higher than that of a model developed for long-term reconstructions used by the ACRIM team for such an analysis. The constructed \&{\#}8216;mixed\&{\#}8217; ACRIM \&{\#}8212; SATIRE composite shows no increase in the TSI from 1986 to 1996, in contrast to the ACRIM TSI composite.},

We find that this hiatus in warming coincides with a period of little increase in the sum of anthropogenic and natural forcings. Declining solar insolation as part of a normal eleven-year cycle, and a cyclical change from an El Nino to a La Nina dominate our measure of anthropogenic effects because rapid growth in short-lived sulfur emissions partially offsets rising greenhouse gas concentrations. As such, we find that recent global temperature records are consistent with the existing understanding of the relationship among global surface temperature, internal variability, and radiative forcing, which includes anthropogenic factors with well known warming and cooling effects.},

	Abstract = {We compare global-scale changes in satellite estimates of the temperature of the lower troposphere (TLT) with model simulations of forced and unforced TLT changes. While previous work has focused on a single period of record, we select analysis timescales ranging from 10 to 32 years, and then compare all possible observed TLT trends on each timescale with corresponding multi-model distributions of forced and unforced trends. We use observed estimates of the signal component of TLT changes and model estimates of climate noise to calculate timescale-dependent signal-to-noise ratios (S/N). These ratios are small (less than 1) on the 10-year timescale, increasing to more than 3.9 for 32-year trends. This large change in S/N is primarily due to a decrease in the amplitude of internally generated variability with increasing trend length. Because of the pronounced effect of interannual noise on decadal trends, a multi-model ensemble of anthropogenically-forced simulations displays many 10-year periods with little warming. A single decade of observational TLT data is therefore inadequate for identifying a slowly evolving anthropogenic warming signal. Our results show that temperature records of at least 17 years in length are required for identifying human effects on global-mean tropospheric temperature.},

	Abstract = {Using a multivariate, \&{\#}8220;patterns-based\&{\#}8221;, red noise approach to 42 years of observed tropical SST, thermocline depth, and zonal wind stress seasonal anomalies, it is shown that natural random variations can account for the observed variability of Central Pacific (CP) and Eastern Pacific (EP) ENSO events. The recent multidecadal increase in the number of CP events relative to EP events, which has been hypothesized to be connected to anthropogenic change in the state of the ocean, is also found to be consistent with multivariate red noise and hence with stationary statistics. ENSO \&{\#}8220;flavors\&{\#}8221; are the consequence of differing combinations of two initially orthogonal spatial patterns that are precursors to CP or EP events of both signs. These precursors can be excited by random weather forcing and subsequently result in SST anomaly amplification primarily through surface or thermocline feedbacks, respectively.},

	Abstract = {High-resolution temperature reconstructions (typically annually to seasonally resolved) have played a key role in understanding paleoclimate immediately prior to the beginning of the instrumental record, especially when calibrated to form an extension of comparable instrumental data coverage (global, hemispheric, and regional). Such calibration allows the information in the instrumental record to be quantitatively extended backward in time in an objective way, enabling description of much longer term fluctuations in climate than possible with instrumental data alone, although with significantly increased uncertainties inherent in proxy-based reconstructions. This data brief describes a newly integrated archive of nearly all the high-resolution temperature reconstructions of the past 2+ millennia included in NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, from small-regional to global scale, which also have been recalibrated to a standard set of instrumental data. Examination of the spectral structure of the data is additionally provided.},

Information criteria are proposed for evaluating models constructed by various estimation procedures when the specified family of probability distributions does not contain the distribution generating the data. The proposed criteria are applied to the evaluation of models estimated by maximum likelihood, robust, penalised likelihood, Bayes procedures, etc. We also discuss the use of the bootstrap in model evaluation problems and present a variance reduction technique in the bootstrap simulation.},

	Abstract = {A bias correction to the Akaike information criterion, AIC, is derived for regression and autoregressive time series models. The correction is of particular use when the sample size is small, or when the number of fitted parameters is a moderate to large fraction of the sample size. The corrected method, called AICC, is asymptotically efficient if the true model is infinite dimensional. Furthermore, when the true model is of finite dimension, AICC is found to provide better model order choices than any other asymptotically efficient method. Applications to nonstationary autoregressive and mixed autoregressive moving average time series models are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Three lines of evidence for abrupt tropical climate change, both past and present, are presented. First, annually and decadally averaged {\OE}¥18O and net mass-balance histories for the last 400 and 2,000 yr, respectively, demonstrate that the current warming at high elevations in the mid- to low latitudes is unprecedented for at least the last 2 millennia. Second, the continuing retreat of most mid- to low-latitude glaciers, many having persisted for thousands of years, signals a recent and abrupt change in the Earth‚{\"A}{\^o}s climate system. Finally, rooted, soft-bodied wetland plants, now exposed along the margins as the Quelccaya ice cap (Peru) retreats, have been radiocarbon dated and, when coupled with other widespread proxy evidence, provide strong evidence for an abrupt mid-Holocene climate event that marked the transition from early Holocene (pre-5,000-yr-B.P.) conditions to cooler, late Holocene (post-5,000-yr-B.P.) conditions. This abrupt event, ‚{\^a}{\`a}5,200 yr ago, was widespread and spatially coherent through much of the tropics and was coincident with structural changes in several civilizations. These three lines of evidence argue that the present warming and associated glacier retreat are unprecedented in some areas for at least 5,200 yr. The ongoing global-scale, rapid retreat of mountain glaciers is not only contributing to global sea-level rise but also threatening freshwater supplies in many of the world‚{\"A}{\^o}s most populous regions.},

	Abstract = {New estimates of measurement and sampling uncertainties of gridded in situ sea surface temperature anomalies are calculated for 1850 to 2006. The measurement uncertainties account for correlations between errors in observations made by the same ship or buoy due, for example, to miscalibration of the thermometer. Correlations between the errors increase the estimated uncertainties on grid box averages. In grid boxes where there are many observations from only a few ships or drifting buoys, this increase can be large. The correlations also increase uncertainties of regional, hemispheric, and global averages above and beyond the increase arising solely from the inflation of the grid box uncertainties. This is due to correlations in the errors between grid boxes visited by the same ship or drifting buoy. At times when reliable estimates can be made, the uncertainties in global average, Southern Hemisphere, and tropical sea surface temperature anomalies are between 2 and 3 times as large as when calculated assuming the errors are uncorrelated. Uncertainties of Northern Hemisphere averages are approximately double. A new estimate is also made of sampling uncertainties. They are largest in regions of high sea surface temperature variability such as the western boundary currents and along the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean. The sampling uncertainties are generally smaller in the tropics and in the ocean gyres.},

Here we present the Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas (MADA), a seasonally resolved gridded spatial reconstruction of Asian monsoon drought and pluvials over the past millennium, derived from a network of tree-ring chronologies. MADA provides the spatiotemporal details of known historic monsoon failures and reveals the occurrence, severity, and fingerprint of previously unknown monsoon megadroughts and their close linkages to large-scale patterns of tropical Indo-Pacific sea surface temperatures. MADA thus provides a long-term context for recent monsoon variability that is critically needed for climate modeling, prediction, and attribution.},

	Abstract = {Northeast tropical Queensland rainfall is concentrated in the summer half year and characterized by high interannual variability, partly related to El Ni{\~n}o\&{\#}8211;Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. This results in highly variable river flows affecting nearshore coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Freshwater flood events are recorded in long-lived, annually banded massive coral skeletons as luminescent lines. Quantitative measurements of luminescence intensity were made for 20 Porites coral cores from nearshore reef sites between 11$\,^{\circ}$S and 23$\,^{\circ}$S. Seventeen of the coral luminescence series were significantly correlated with an instrumental record of northeast Queensland summer rainfall and were used to develop seven significantly calibrated and verified rainfall reconstructions based on between 17 (starting 1891) and 1 (starting 1639) coral series. The longest reconstruction, based on more than one coral, provides insights into northeast Queensland rainfall variability from the late 17th century. Comparisons with various independent climate proxies are equivocal: the magnitude and significance of relationships with, for example, a proxy ENSO index vary through time. An extended drier period reconstructed from approximately the 1760s to the 1850s is associated with lower interannual rainfall variability. Since the late 19th century average rainfall and its variability have significantly increased, with wet and dry extremes becoming more frequent than in earlier centuries. This suggests that a warming global climate maybe associated with more variable tropical Queensland rainfall.},

	Abstract = {Ancient Montezuma baldcypress (Taxodium mucronatum) trees found in Barranca de Amealco, Queretaro, have been used to develop a 1,238-year tree-ring chronology that is correlated with precipitation, temperature, drought indices, and crop yields in central Mexico. This chronology has been used to reconstruct the spring-early summer soil moisture balance over the heartland of the Mesoamerican cultural province, and is the first exactly dated, annually resolved paleoclimatic record for Mesoamerica spanning the Late Classic, Post Classic, Colonial, and modern eras. The reconstruction indicates that the Terminal Classic drought extended into central Mexico, supporting other sedimentary and speleothem evidence for this early 10th century drought in Mesoamerica. The reconstruction also documents severe and sustained drought during the decline of the Toltec state (1149\&{\#}8211;1167) and during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec state (1514\&{\#}8211;1539), providing a new precisely dated climate framework for Mesoamerican cultural change.},

Here we report evidence from an annually laminated lake sediment record from southeastern Kenya for interannual to centennial-scale changes in ENSO-related rainfall variability during the last three millennia and for reductions in both the mean rate and the variability of rainfall in East Africa during the Last Glacial period. Climate model simulations support forward extrapolation from these lake sediment data that future warming will intensify the interannual variability of East Africa's rainfall.},

@article{Neelin_PNAS10,
	Abstract = {Climate models exhibit high sensitivity in some respects, such as for differences in predicted precipitation changes under global warming. Despite successful large-scale simulations, regional climatology features prove difficult to constrain toward observations, with challenges including high-dimensionality, computationally expensive simulations, and ambiguity in the choice of objective function. In an atmospheric General Circulation Model forced by observed sea surface temperature or coupled to a mixed-layer ocean, many climatic variables yield rms-error objective functions that vary smoothly through the feasible parameter range. This smoothness occurs despite nonlinearity strong enough to reverse the curvature of the objective function in some parameters, and to imply limitations on multimodel ensemble means as an estimator of global warming precipitation changes. Low-order polynomial fits to the model output spatial fields as a function of parameter (quadratic in model field, fourth-order in objective function) yield surprisingly successful metamodels for many quantities and facilitate a multiobjective optimization approach. Tradeoffs arise as optima for different variables occur at different parameter values, but with agreement in certain directions. Optima often occur at the limit of the feasible parameter range, identifying key parameterization aspects warranting attention‚{\"A}{\^\i}here the interaction of convection with free tropospheric water vapor. Analytic results for spatial fields of leading contributions to the optimization help to visualize tradeoffs at a regional level, e.g., how mismatches between sensitivity and error spatial fields yield regional error under minimization of global objective functions. The approach is sufficiently simple to guide parameter choices and to aid intercomparison of sensitivity properties among climate models.},

	Abstract = {Climate models robustly predict that the climate of southwestern North America, defined as the area from the western Great Plains to the Pacific Ocean and from the Oregon border to southern Mexico, will dry throughout the current century as a consequence of rising greenhouse gases. This regional drying is part of a general drying of the subtropics and poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zones. Through an analysis of 15 coupled climate models it is shown here that the drying is driven by a reduction of winter season precipitation associated with increased moisture divergence by the mean flow and reduced moisture convergence by transient eddies. Due to the presence of large amplitude decadal variations of presumed natural origin, observations to date cannot confirm that this transition to a drier climate is already underway, but it is anticipated that the anthropogenic drying will reach the amplitude of natural decadal variability by midcentury. In addition to this drop in total precipitation, warming is already causing a decline in mountain snow mass and an advance in the timing of spring snow melt disrupting the natural water storage systems that are part of the region‚{\"A}{\^o}s water supply system. Uncertainties in how radiative forcing will impact the tropical Pacific climate system create uncertainties in the amplitude of drying in southwest North America with a La Ni√$\pm$a-like response creating a worst case scenario of greater drying.},

	Abstract = {Observations since the middle of the 19th century show that the decadal solar oscillation at its peaks strengthens the major convergence zones in the tropical Pacific (Intertropical Convergence Zone, ITCZ, and South Pacific Convergence Zone, SPCZ) during northern winter. Through an amplifying set of coupled feedbacks, a set of processes is described that link solar forcing and its response in the tropical Pacific with reductions in precipitation in the northwest United States. The process begins with an increase in solar forcing which results in a strengthening of the major convergence zones in the tropical Pacific. This then increases the precipitation in those regions and increases the southeast trade winds. Stronger trades increase the upwelling of colder water in the eastern equatorial Pacific and extend the cold tongue westward, thus reducing precipitation in the western Pacific. This redistribution of diabatic heating and associated convective heating anomalies thus produces anomalies in the tropical Hadley (north-south) and Walker (east-west) circulations. The former weakens as subsidence in equatorial latitudes is enhanced; the latter strengthens and extends westward. Additionally, the resulting anomalous Rossby wave response in the atmosphere, and consequent positive sea level pressure anomalies in the eastern region of the Aleutian low in the North Pacific that extends to western North America, is associated with reductions of precipitation in the northwest United States. The response of the climate system to solar forcing is manifested as a strengthening of the climatological precipitation maxima in the tropics.},

	Abstract = {The phenomenon of 11-year solar cycles has a well-measured forcing, and the response in surface temperature is confirmed using multiple datasets, including reanalysis (NCEP/NCAR and ERA-40) and blended in situ land-ocean data (GISS and HadCRUT3). Missing coverage in the historical in situ station data reduces the amplitude of the response compared to the geographically complete reanalysis data, but all extracted signals are statistically robust. A transient climate sensitivity parameter can be defined once forcing and response are known. The coupled atmosphere-ocean models participating in the 4th Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) span a large range in their transient climate response (TCR). Using observational results on the response to the 11-year solar variation, we derive a constraint for the TCR. It is seen that, compared with our derived constraint, most models assessed by IPCC AR4 have too low a TCR, even lower than that derived from the station data.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the influence of solar variability on the Earth's climate requires knowledge of solar variability, solar-terrestrial interactions, and the mechanisms determining the response of the Earth's climate system. We provide a summary of our current understanding in each of these three areas. Observations and mechanisms for the Sun's variability are described, including solar irradiance variations on both decadal and centennial time scales and their relation to galactic cosmic rays. Corresponding observations of variations of the Earth's climate on associated time scales are described, including variations in ozone, temperatures, winds, clouds, precipitation, and regional modes of variability such as the monsoons and the North Atlantic Oscillation. A discussion of the available solar and climate proxies is provided. Mechanisms proposed to explain these climate observations are described, including the effects of variations in solar irradiance and of charged particles. Finally, the contributions of solar variations to recent observations of global climate change are discussed.},

	Abstract = {One of the mysteries regarding Earth‚{\"A}{\^o}s climate system response to variations in solar output is how the relatively small fluctuations of the 11-year solar cycle can produce the magnitude of the observed climate signals in the tropical Pacific associated with such solar variability. Two mechanisms, the top-down stratospheric response of ozone to fluctuations of shortwave solar forcing and the bottom-up coupled ocean-atmosphere surface response, are included in versions of three global climate models, with either mechanism acting alone or both acting together. We show that the two mechanisms act together to enhance the climatological off-equatorial tropical precipitation maxima in the Pacific, lower the eastern equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures during peaks in the 11-year solar cycle, and reduce low-latitude clouds to amplify the solar forcing at the surface.},

@article{Cook_Holo95,
	Abstract = {The problem of constructing millennia-long tree-ring chronologies from overlapping segments of cross-dated ring-width series is reviewed, with an emphasis on preserving very low-frequency signals potentially due to climate. In so doing, a fundamental statistical problem coined the 'segment length curse' is introduced. This 'curse' is related to the fact that the maximum wavelength of recoverable climatic information is ordinarily related to the lengths of the individual tree-ring series used to construct the millennia-long chronology. Simple experiments with sine waves are used to illustrate this fact. This is followed by more realistic experiments using a long bristlecone pine series that is randomly cut into a number of 1000-, 500- and 200-year segments and standardized using three very conservative methods. When compared against the original, uncut series, the resulting 'chronologies' show the effects of segment length even when the most conservative and noncommittal method of tree-ring standardiza tion is applied (i.e., a horizontal line through the mean). Alternative schemes of chronology development are described that seek to exorcise the segment length curse. While they show some promise, none is universal in its applicability and this problem still remains largely unsolved.},

	Abstract = {SummaryMany statistical procedures are, strictly speaking, only appropriate when a simplifying assumption about the shape of an error distribution is made, and such an assumption may need to be checked against departures in specific parametric directions. A number of ‚{\"A}{\`o}diagnostic‚{\"A}{\^o} test procedures are summarized in which location and scale may be unknown, and examples are given in the context of testing for an exponential or Gaussian shape. Approximate efficient scores are emphasized which lead to both well known and novel test statistics. In particular, we show that the standard measures of skewness and kurtosis are asymptotically locally optimal test statistics for normality against departures in the log gamma and Student t family respectively. The properties of two new test statistics are briefly investigated.},

@article{Gleckler_JGR08,
	Abstract = {Objective measures of climate model performance are proposed and used to assess simulations of the 20th century, which are available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) archive. The primary focus of this analysis is on the climatology of atmospheric fields. For each variable considered, the models are ranked according to a measure of relative error. Based on an average of the relative errors over all fields considered, some models appear to perform substantially better than others. Forming a single index of model performance, however, can be misleading in that it hides a more complex picture of the relative merits of different models. This is demonstrated by examining individual variables and showing that the relative ranking of models varies considerably from one variable to the next. A remarkable exception to this finding is that the so-called \&{\#}8220;mean model\&{\#}8221; consistently outperforms all other models in nearly every respect. The usefulness, limitations and robustness of the metrics defined here are evaluated 1) by examining whether the information provided by each metric is correlated in any way with the others, and 2) by determining how sensitive the metrics are to such factors as observational uncertainty, spatial scale, and the domain considered (e.g., tropics versus extra-tropics). An index that gauges the fidelity of model variability on interannual time-scales is found to be only weakly correlated with an index of the mean climate performance. This illustrates the importance of evaluating a broad spectrum of climate processes and phenomena since accurate simulation of one aspect of climate does not guarantee accurate representation of other aspects. Once a broad suite of metrics has been developed to characterize model performance it may become possible to identify optimal subsets for various applications.},

	Abstract = {We consider estimation of the long term average power output from a wind turbine generator at a site for which few data on wind speeds are available. Long term records of wind speeds at the 12 synoptic meteorological stations are also used. Inference is based on a simple and parsimonious approximating model which accounts for the main features of wind speeds in Ireland, namely seasonal effects, spatial correlation, short-memory temporal autocorrelation and long-memory temporal dependence. It synthesizes deseasonalization, kriging, ARMA modelling and fractional differencing in a natural way. A simple kriging estimator performs well as a point estimator, and good interval estimators result from the model. The resulting procedure is easy to apply in practice.},

	Abstract = {Abstract~~Using observations covering the last 128~years we show that apparent changes in El Ni�o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnections can be explained by chance and stem from sampling variability. This result is backed by experiments in which an atmosphere model is driven by 123&nbsp;years of observed sea surface temperature. The possibility of ENSO teleconnection changes in a warming climate is further investigated using coupled GCMs driven by past and projected future greenhouse gas concentrations. These runs do not exclude physical changes in the teleconnection strength but do not agree on their magnitude and location. If existing at all, changes in the strength of ENSO teleconnection, other than obtained by chance, are small and will only be detectable on centennial time scales. },

	Abstract = {This study compares the global distribution of 20th century SST and marine air temperature trends from a wide variety of data sets including un-interpolated archives as well as globally-complete reconstructions. Apart from the eastern equatorial Pacific, all datasets show consistency in their statistically significant trends, with warming everywhere except the far northwestern Atlantic; the largest warming trends are found in the middle latitudes of both hemispheres. Two of the SST reconstructions exhibit statistically significant cooling trends over the eastern equatorial Pacific, in disagreement with the un-interpolated SST and marine air temperature datasets which show statistically significant warming in this region. Twentieth century trends in tropical marine cloudiness, precipitation and SLP from independent data sets provide physically consistent evidence for a reduction in the strength of the atmospheric Walker Circulation accompanied by an eastward shift of deep convection from the western to the central equatorial Pacific.},

	Abstract = {To evaluate and extend the record of decadal climate variability, we present a synthesis of 23 coral oxygen isotope records from the tropical Indo\&{\#}8208;Pacific that extends back to A.D. 1850. Principal components analysis (PCA) on detrended records reveals a leading pattern of variance with significant interannual (3\&{\#}8211;5 year) and decadal (9\&{\#}8211;14 year) variability. The temporal evolution and spatial pattern of this variability closely resembles the El Ni{\`O}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) pattern across both time scales, suggesting that this decadal tropical variability is fundamentally related to ENSO. The 19th century experienced stronger decadal tropical climate variability, compared to the 20th. Decadal variability in the tropical oceans thus remains underestimated by analysis of direct observations.},

@article{TungCamp08,
	Abstract = {The total solar irradiance (TSI) has been measured by orbiting satellites since 1978 to vary on an 11-year cycle by about 0.08{\%}. Because of previous controversies on the reality of solar cycle response at the surface, in this work we discuss the robustness of the solar response with respect to analysis methods, data sets and periods used. Furthermore we concentrate on the globally coherent signal. Two reanalysis data sets are used: one is from National Centers for Environmental Prediction and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP for short) and the other is the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)'s most recent reanalysis denoted by ERA-40. Three analysis methods are considered, with increasing sophistication. Within each data set the analysis results are consistent with each other (i.e., each within the other's error bars), with the method of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) yielding the smallest error bar and the unfiltered global mean data yielding the largest error bar in the temperature amplitude. All three methods and both data sets are able to demonstrate that the 11-year signal is statistically significant and attributable (i.e., related) to the solar cycle. We deduce the spatial surface pattern over the globe which best distinguishes the solar maximum years from the solar minimum years using the LDA method. The resulting warming pattern shows clearly the polar amplification of warming and the preference for continents over oceans. We propose that the magnitude of the surface warming is consistent with direct solar radiative forcing if positive feedback processes such as ice albedo, water vapor/lapse rate and cloud feedbacks, similar to some of those studied for the greenhouse warming problem, are incorporated. It does not appear to be necessary to invoke some previously proposed exotic indirect mechanisms for an explanation of the observed solar signal.},

	Abstract = {Global temperatures are known to have varied over the past 1500 years, but the spatial patterns have remained poorly defined. We used a global climate proxy network to reconstruct surface temperature patterns over this interval. The Medieval period is found to display warmth that matches or exceeds that of the past decade in some regions, but which falls well below recent levels globally. This period is marked by a tendency for La Nina-like conditions in the tropical Pacific. The coldest temperatures of the Little Ice Age are observed over the interval 1400 to 1700 C.E., with greatest cooling over the extratropical Northern Hemisphere continents. The patterns of temperature change imply dynamical responses of climate to natural radiative forcing changes involving El Nino and the North Atlantic Oscillation-Arctic Oscillation. },

	Abstract = {Climatic changes resulting from greenhouse gases will be superimposed on natural climatic variations. High-resolution proxy records of past climate can be used to extend our perspective on regional and hemispheric changes of climate back in time by several hundred years. Using historical, tree-ring and ice core data, we examine climatic variations during the period commonly called the 'Little Ice Age'. The coldest conditions of the last 560 years were between AD 1570 and 1730, and in the nineteenth century. Unusually warm conditions have prevailed since the 1920s, probably related to a relative absence of major explosive volcanic eruptions and higher levels of greenhouse gases. },

	Abstract = {Standard statistical practice ignores model uncertainty. Data analysts typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples. In these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample predictive performance. We also provide a catalogue of currently available BMA software.},

@article{Dutay10,
	Abstract = {Abstract~~There is ongoing controversy as to the dynamical significance of geothermal heat flow in shaping the abyssal circulation. In this paper, we gauge the impact of geothermal heating and vertical mixing parameterizations in the general circulation model OPA. The experiments are evaluated by comparing simulated mantle 3He with observations collected during the GEOSECS and WOCE programs. This tracer is particularly adapted to the validation of our numerical simulations because its injection into the ocean interior is tightly linked to geothermal processes. In agreement with previous studies, the model circulation is found very sensitive to the parameterization of the vertical mixing. The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is globally intensified when moving from a constant mixing to a version with enhanced mixing near the ocean bottom, with the most drastic variation observed for AABW (+&nbsp;50%). Adding the geothermal heat flux mainly affects AABW circulation in the model, enhancing it all the more as the meridional circulation is slow (low vertical mixing), but proportionally less so when it is more vigorous (enhanced vertical mixing). This can be understood from the requirement of the abyssal ocean to maintain heat balance. The evaluation with mantle 3He simulations reveals that the version with low vertical mixing, with its sluggish circulation, produces unrealistically high a 3He isotopic composition. However, with a vertical mixing that is enhanced at depth, the 3He distribution falls within an acceptable range of values in the deep ocean. Finally, adding the geothermal heating to this enhanced mixing case provides a substantial improvement of the simulation of AABW in all basins but the Indian Ocean. 3He isotopic composition is then in good agreement with the observations. Taken jointly with observational estimates of the MOC intensity, these independent isotopic constraints suggest that both geothermal heating and enhanced diapycnal mixing at depth are key ingredients in the realistic simulation of abyssal circulation. },

	Abstract = {Abstract~~The paper discusses the performance and robustness of the Bayesian (probabilistic) approach to seismic tomography enhanced by the numerical Monte Carlo sampling technique. The approach is compared with two other popular techniques, namely the damped least-squares (LSQR) method and the general optimization approach. The theoretical considerations are illustrated by an analysis of seismic data from the Rudna (Poland) copper mine. Contrary to the LSQR and optimization techniques the Bayesian approach allows for construction of not only the ``best-fitting'' model of the sought velocity distribution but also other estimators, for example the average model which is often expected to be a more robust estimator than the maximum likelihood solution. We demonstrate that using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling technique within the Bayesian approach opens up the possibility of analyzing tomography imaging uncertainties with minimal additional computational effort compared to the robust optimization approach. On the basis of the considered example it is concluded that the Monte Carlo based Bayesian approach offers new possibilities of robust and reliable tomography imaging. },

@article{diNezio_JClim09,
	Abstract = {The climate response of the equatorial Pacific to increased greenhouse gases is investigated using numerical experiments from 11 climate models participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\&{\#}8217;s Fourth Assessment Report. Multimodel mean climate responses to CO2 doubling are identified and related to changes in the heat budget of the surface layer. Weaker ocean surface currents driven by a slowing down of the Walker circulation reduce ocean dynamical cooling throughout the equatorial Pacific. The combined anomalous ocean dynamical plus radiative heating from CO2 is balanced by different processes in the western and eastern basins: Cloud cover feedbacks and evaporation balance the heating over the warm pool, while increased cooling by ocean vertical heat transport balances the warming over the cold tongue. This increased cooling by vertical ocean heat transport arises from increased near-surface thermal stratification, despite a reduction in vertical velocity. The stratification response is found to be a permanent feature of the equilibrium climate potentially linked to both thermodynamical and dynamical changes within the equatorial Pacific. Briefly stated, ocean dynamical changes act to reduce (enhance) the net heating in the east (west). This explains why the models simulate enhanced equatorial warming, rather than El Ni\~no\&{\#}8211;like warming, in response to a weaker Walker circulation. To conclude, the implications for detecting these signals in the modern observational record are discussed. },

Diatom productivity south of the Antarctic Polar Front and the subsequent burial of biogenic opal in underlying sediments are limited by this silicon supply. We show that opal burial rates, and thus upwelling, were enhanced during the termination of the last ice age in each sector of the Southern Ocean. In the record with the greatest temporal resolution, we find evidence for two intervals of enhanced upwelling concurrent with the two intervals of rising atmospheric CO2 during deglaciation. These results directly link increased ventilation of deep water to the deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2. },

	Abstract = {We investigate aragonitic skeletons of the Caribbean sclerosponge Ceratoporella nicholsoni from Jamaica, 20 m below sea level (mbsl), and Pedro Bank, 125 mbsl. We use $\delta^{18}${O} and Sr/Ca ratios as temperature proxies to reconstruct the Caribbean mixed layer and thermocline temperature history since 1400 A.D. with a decadal time resolution. Our age models are based on U/Th dating and locating of the radiocarbon bomb spike. The modern temperature difference between the two sites is used to tentatively calibrate the C. nicholsoni Sr/Ca thermometer. The resulting calibration points to a temperature sensitivity of Sr/Ca in C. nicholsoni aragonite of about −0.1 mmol/mol/K. Our Sr/Ca records reveal a pronounced warming from the early 19th to the late 20th century, both at 20 and 125 mbsl. Two temperature minima in the shallow water record during the late 17th and early 19th century correspond to the Maunder and Dalton sunspot minima, respectively. Another major cooling occurred in the late 16th century and is not correlatable with a sunspot minimum. The temperature contrast between the two sites decreased from the 14th century to a minimum in the late 17th century and subsequently increased to modern values in the early 19th century. This is interpreted as a long-term deepening and subsequent shoaling of the Caribbean thermocline. The major trends of the Sr/Ca records are reproduced in both specimens but hardly reflected in the $\delta^{18}${O} records.},

@article{Kuttel09,
	Abstract = {Abstract~~Local to regional climate anomalies are to a large extent determined by the state of the atmospheric circulation. The knowledge of large-scale sea level pressure (SLP) variations in former times is therefore crucial when addressing past climate changes across Europe and the Mediterranean. However, currently available SLP reconstructions lack data from the ocean, particularly in the pre-1850 period. Here we present a new statistically-derived 5$\,^{\circ}$&nbsp;×&nbsp;5$\,^{\circ}$ resolved gridded seasonal SLP dataset covering the eastern North Atlantic, Europe and the Mediterranean area (40$\,^{\circ}$W--50$\,^{\circ}$E; 20$\,^{\circ}$N--70$\,^{\circ}$N) back to 1750 using terrestrial instrumental pressure series and marine wind information from ship logbooks. For the period 1750--1850, the new SLP reconstruction provides a more accurate representation of the strength of the winter westerlies as well as the location and variability of the Azores High than currently available multiproxy pressure field reconstructions. These findings strongly support the potential of ship logbooks as an important source to determine past circulation variations especially for the pre-1850 period. This new dataset can be further used for dynamical studies relating large-scale atmospheric circulation to temperature and precipitation variability over the Mediterranean and Eurasia, for the comparison with outputs from GCMs as well as for detection and attribution studies. },

	Abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

Using a coordinate descent procedure for the lasso, we develop a simple algorithm--the graphical lasso--that is remarkably fast: It solves a 1000-node problem ([~]500000 parameters) in at most a minute and is 30-4000 times faster than competing methods. It also provides a conceptual link between the exact problem and the approximation suggested by Meinshausen and Buhlmann (2006). We illustrate the method on some cell-signaling data from proteomics.

We study the method of generalized cross-validation (GCV) for choosing a good value λ̂ for λ, from the data. The estimate λ̂ is the minimizer of V(λ) given by $V(\lambda)=\frac{1}{n}\|(I-A(\lambda))y\|^{2}/\left[\frac{1}{n}\text{Trace}(I-A(\lambda))\right]^{2}$ , where A(λ)=X(XTX+nλ I)-1XT. This estimate is a rotation-invariant version of Allen's PRESS, or ordinary cross-validation. This estimate behaves like a risk improvement estimator, but does not require an estimate of σ 2, so can be used when n - p is small, or even if p ≥ n in certain cases. The GCV method can also be used in subset selection and singular value truncation methods for regression, and even to choose from among mixtures of these methods.},

	Abstract = {Abstract~~We present seasonal precipitation reconstructions for European land areas (30$\,^{\circ}$W to 40$\,^{\circ}$E/30--71$\,^{\circ}$N; given on a 0.5$\,^{\circ}$×0.5$\,^{\circ}$resolved grid) covering the period 1500--1900 together with gridded reanalysis from 1901 to 2000 (Mitchell and Jones 2005). Principal component regression techniques were applied to develop this dataset. A large variety of long instrumental precipitation series, precipitation indices based on documentary evidence and natural proxies (tree-ring chronologies, ice cores, corals and a speleothem) that are sensitive to precipitation signals were used as predictors. Transfer functions were derived over the 1901--1983 calibration period and applied to 1500--1900 in order to reconstruct the large-scale precipitation fields over Europe. The performance (quality estimation based on unresolved variance within the calibration period) of the reconstructions varies over centuries, seasons and space. Highest reconstructive skill was found for winter over central Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. Precipitation variability over the last half millennium reveals both large interannual and decadal fluctuations. Applying running correlations, we found major non-stationarities in the relation between large-scale circulation and regional precipitation. For several periods during the last 500&nbsp;years, we identified key atmospheric modes for southern Spain/northern Morocco and central Europe as representations of two precipitation regimes. Using scaled composite analysis, we show that precipitation extremes over central Europe and southern Spain are linked to distinct pressure patterns. Due to its high spatial and temporal resolution, this dataset allows detailed studies of regional precipitation variability for all seasons, impact studies on different time and space scales, comparisons with high-resolution climate models as well as analysis of connections with regional temperature reconstructions. },

	Abstract = {Multiproxy reconstructions of monthly and seasonal surface temperature fields for Europe back to 1500 show that the late 20th- and early 21st-century European climate is very likely (>95% confidence level) warmer than that of any time during the past 500 years. This agrees with findings for the entire Northern Hemisphere. European winter average temperatures during the period 1500 to 1900 were reduced by [~]0.5{degrees}C (0.25{degrees}C for annual mean temperatures) compared to the 20th century. Summer temperatures did not experience systematic century-scale cooling relative to present conditions. The coldest European winter was 1708/1709; 2003 was by far the hottest summer.

	Abstract = {We evaluate the skill of a European winter surface air temperature reconstruction over the last 500 years using pseudoproxies obtained from the ECHO-G and HadCM3 climate models. The emphasis is thereby on the effect of the reduction of available predictors back in time, an issue that has not yet been investigated in detail at continental and seasonal scale. It is found that the key factor in determining the reconstruction skill is the number of predictors and particularly their spatial distribution. However considering the usually insufficient spatial and temporal predictor availability in paleo-reconstructions, the quality of the predictors becomes more important further back in time. Not surprisingly, the lowest reconstruction skill is found in the early period when the predictor network is reduced. Important differences between ECHO-G and HadCM3-based pseudoproxy reconstructions are discussed and implications for future analyses are presented.},

	Abstract = {A general approach is presented for estimating statistics of a random process from a finite data set from an irregularly spaced array of measurement locations. Particular attention is focused upon estimation of the spectrum under circumstances where it is smooth (i.e., broadband). A procedure is proposed based upon the technique of optimal linear estimation or generalized least squares fits in order to estimate coefficients of spectral features of interest to the investigator. Selection of which features are appropriate for estimation from a given array and set of measurements is made within the formalism of Bayesian statistical inference. The converse problem is also addressed: given a set of spectral features and a fixed number of possible measurements, which configuration of measurement locations will yield the most information about the amplitudes of those features? Finally, an assessment is made of the efficiency (i.e., the bias and accuracy) of various previously proposed methods of spectral estimation from irregular arrays.},

	Abstract = {The leading modes of variability of the extratropical circulation in both hemispheres are characterized by deep, zonally symmetric or \&{\#}8220;annular\&{\#}8221; structures, with geopotential height perturbations of opposing signs in the polar cap region and in the surrounding zonal ring centered near 45{${}^\circ$} latitude. The structure and dynamics of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode have been extensively documented, whereas the existence of a Northern Hemisphere (NH) mode, herein referred to as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), has only recently been recognized. Like the SH mode, the AO can be defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function of the sea level pressure field or of the zonally symmetric geopotential height or zonal wind fields. In this paper the structure and seasonality of the NH and SH modes are compared based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction\&{\#}8211;National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis and supplementary datasets. The structures of the NH and SH annular modes are shown to be remarkably similar, not only in the zonally averaged geopotential height and zonal wind fields, but in the mean meridional circulations as well. Both exist year-round in the troposphere, but they amplify with height upward into the stratosphere during those seasons in which the strength of the zonal flow is conducive to strong planetary wave\&{\#}8211;mean flow interaction: midwinter in the NH and late spring in the SH. During these \&{\#}8220;active seasons,\&{\#}8221; the annular modes modulate the strength of the Lagrangian mean circulation in the lower stratosphere, total column ozone and tropopause height over mid- and high latitudes, and the strength of the trade winds of their respective hemispheres. The NH mode also contains an embedded planetary wave signature with expressions in surface air temperature, precipitation, total column ozone, and tropopause height. It is argued that the horizontal temperature advection by the perturbed zonal-mean zonal wind field in the lower troposphere is instrumental in forcing this pattern. A companion paper documents the striking resemblance between the structure of the annular modes and observed climate trends over the past few decades. },

	Abstract = {The potential for the mean climate of the tropical Pacific to shift to more El Ni{\~n}o-like conditions as a result of human induced climate change is subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty. The complexity of the feedback processes, the wide range of responses of different atmosphere--ocean global circulation models (AOGCMs) and difficulties with model simulation of present day El Ni{\~n}o southern oscillation (ENSO), all complicate the picture. By examining the components of the climate-change response that projects onto the model pattern of ENSO variability in 20 AOGCMs submitted to the coupled model inter-comparison project (CMIP), it is shown that large-scale coupled atmosphere--ocean feedbacks associated with the present day ENSO also operate on longer climate-change time scales. By linking the realism of the simulation of present day ENSO variability in the models to their patterns of future mean El Ni{\~n}o-like or La Ni{\~n}a-like climate change, it is found that those models that have the largest ENSO-like climate change also have the poorest simulation of ENSO variability. The most likely scenario (p=0.59) in a model-skill-weighted histogram of CMIP models is for no trend towards either mean El Ni{\~n}o-like or La Ni{\~n}a-like conditions. However, there remains a small probability (p=0.16) for a change to El Ni{\~n}o-like conditions of the order of one standard El Ni{\~n}o per century in the 1{\%} per year CO2 increase scenario.},

	Abstract = {This review of late-Holocene palaeoclimatology represents the results from a PAGES/CLIVAR Intersection Panel meeting that took place in June 2006. The review is in three parts: the principal high-resolution proxy disciplines (trees, corals, ice cores and documentary evidence), emphasizing current issues in their use for climate reconstruction; the various approaches that have been adopted to combine multiple climate proxy records to provide estimates of past annual-to-decadal timescale Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures and other climate variables, such as large-scale circulation indices; and the forcing histories used in climate model simulations of the past millennium. We discuss the need to develop a framework through which current and new approaches to interpreting these proxy data may be rigorously assessed using pseudo-proxies derived from climate model runs, where the `answer' is known. The article concludes with a list of recommendations. First, more raw proxy data are required from the diverse disciplines and from more locations, as well as replication, for all proxy sources, of the basic raw measurements to improve absolute dating, and to better distinguish the proxy climate signal from noise. Second, more effort is required to improve the understanding of what individual proxies respond to, supported by more site measurements and process studies. These activities should also be mindful of the correlation structure of instrumental data, indicating which adjacent proxy records ought to be in agreement and which not. Third, large-scale climate reconstructions should be attempted using a wide variety of techniques, emphasizing those for which quantified errors can be estimated at specified timescales. Fourth, a greater use of climate model simulations is needed to guide the choice of reconstruction techniques (the pseudo-proxy concept) and possibly help determine where, given limited resources, future sampling should be concentrated.

@article{Bocaletti04,
	Abstract = {The salient feature of the oceanic thermal structure is a remarkably shallow thermocline, especially in the Tropics and subtropics. What factors determine its depth? Theories for the deep thermohaline circulation provide an answer that depends on oceanic diffusivity, but they deny the surface winds an explicit role. Theories for the shallow ventilated thermocline take into account the influence of the wind explicitly, but only if the thermal structure in the absence of any winds, the thermal structure along the eastern boundary, is given. To complete and marry the existing theories for the oceanic thermal structure, this paper invokes the constraint of a balanced heat budget for the ocean. The oceanic heat gain occurs primarily in the upwelling zones of the Tropics and subtropics and depends strongly on oceanic conditions, specifically the depth of the thermocline. The heat gain is large when the thermocline is shallow but is small when the thermocline is deep. The constraint of a balanced heat budget therefore implies that an increase in heat loss in high latitudes can result in a shoaling of the tropical thermocline; a decrease in heat loss can cause a deepening of the thermocline. Calculations with an idealized general circulation model of the ocean confirm these inferences. Arguments based on a balanced heat budget yield an expression for the depth of the thermocline in terms of parameters such as the imposed surface winds, the surface temperature gradient, and the oceanic diffusivity. These arguments in effect bridge the theories for the ventilated thermocline and the thermohaline circulation so that previous scaling arguments are recovered as special cases of a general result. },

	Abstract = {An Ocean General Circulation Model is used to investigate the oceanic response to the March 1997 Westerly Wind Event that is suggested to have played an important role in the onset of the 1997--1998 El Ni{\~n}o. Our results point out three distinct impacts. First a strong wind-forced downwelling Kelvin wave propagates eastward generating sea surface temperature anomalies up to 1$\,^{\circ}$C and large subsurface temperature and zonal current anomalies, mainly located in the core of the thermocline. Second the northward and westward extension of this wind event is responsible for a surface advection of cold waters from 130$\,^{\circ}$E--5$\,^{\circ}$N to the equator. Third it generates large zonal surface currents at the eastern edge of the warm and fresh pool by a nonlinear interaction between the wind-forced surface jet and the local thermohaline front. Salinity through both its contribution to the local zonal pressure gradient at the front and the barrier layer effect is crucial in the occurrence of this nonlinear mechanism. The fast displacement of the front (2000 km in a month) together with the cooling in the western Pacific is likely to be responsible for the eastward displacement of atmospheric deep convection and eastward winds observed in April--June 1997 and thus to have played a major role in initiating the El Ni{\~n}o of the century.},

	Abstract = {{Time series for the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and global
   tropospheric temperature anomalies (GTTA) are compared for the
   1958-2008 period. GTTA are represented by data from satellite microwave
   sensing units (MSU) for the period 1980-2008 and from radiosondes
   (RATPAC) for 1958-2008. After the removal from the data set of short
   periods of temperature perturbation that relate to near-equator
   volcanic eruption, we use derivatives to document the presence of a 5-
   to 7-month delayed close relationship between SOI and GTTA. Change in
   SOI accounts for 72\% of the variance in GTTA for the 29-year-long MSU
   record and 68\% of the variance in GTTA for the longer 50-year RATPAC
   record. Because El Nino-Southern Oscillation is known to exercise a
   particularly strong influence in the tropics, we also compared the SOI
   with tropical temperature anomalies between 20 degrees S and 20 degrees
   N. The results showed that SOI accounted for 81\% of the variance in
   tropospheric temperature anomalies in the tropics. Overall the results
   suggest that the Southern Oscillation exercises a consistently dominant
   influence on mean global temperature, with a maximum effect in the
   tropics, except for periods when equatorial volcanism causes ad hoc
   cooling. That mean global tropospheric temperature has for the last 50
   years fallen and risen in close accord with the SOI of 5-7 months
   earlier shows the potential of natural forcing mechanisms to account
   for most of the temperature variation.}},

@article{AmmanWahl07,
	Abstract = {Abstract~~A portion of the debate about climate reconstructions of the past millennium, and in particular about the well-known Mann-Bradley-Hughes (``MBH'' 1998, 1999) reconstructions, has become disconnected from the goal of understanding natural climate variability. Here, we reflect on what can be learned from recent scientific exchanges and identify important challenges that remain to be addressed openly and productively by the community. One challenge arises from the real, underlying trend in temperatures during the instrumental period. This trend can affect regression-based reconstruction performance in cases where the calibration period does not appropriately cover the range of conditions encountered during the reconstruction. However, because it is tied to a unique spatial pattern driven by change in radiative balance, the trend cannot simply be removed in the method of climate field reconstruction used by MBH on the statistical argument of preserving degrees of freedom. More appropriately, the influence from the trend can be taken into account in some methods of significance testing. We illustrate these considerations as they apply to the MBH reconstruction and show that it remains robust back to AD 1450, and given other empirical information also back to AD 1000. However, there is now a need to move beyond hemispheric average temperatures and to focus instead on resolving climate variability at the socially more relevant regional scale. },

	Abstract = {A control simulation of the GFDL CM2.1 global coupled GCM, run for 2000 years with its atmospheric composition, solar irradiance, and land cover held fixed at 1860 values, exhibits strong interdecadal and intercentennial modulation of its ENSO behavior. To the extent that such modulation is realistic, it could attach large uncertainties to ENSO metrics diagnosed from centennial and shorter records --with important implications for historical and paleo records, climate projections, and model assessment and intercomparison. Analysis of the wait times between ENSO warm events suggests that such slow modulation need not require multidecadal memory; it can arise simply from Poisson statistics applied to ENSO's interannual time scale and seasonal phase-locking.},

	Abstract = {How anthropogenic climate change will affect hydroclimate in the arid regions of southwestern North America has implications for the allocation of water resources and the course of regional development. Here we show that there is a broad consensus among climate models that this region will dry in the 21st century and that the transition to a more arid climate should already be under way. If these models are correct, the levels of aridity of the recent multiyear drought or the Dust Bowl and the 1950s droughts will become the new climatology of the American Southwest within a time frame of years to decades.

@article{Cassou07,
	Abstract = {Extratropical SSTs can be influenced by the \&{\#}8220;reemergence mechanism,\&{\#}8221; whereby thermal anomalies in the deep winter mixed layer persist at depth through summer and are then reentrained into the mixed layer in the following winter. The impact of reemergence in the North Atlantic Ocean (NAO) upon the climate system is investigated using an atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a mixed layer ocean/thermodynamic sea ice model.The dominant pattern of thermal anomalies below the mixed layer in summer in a 150-yr control integration is associated with the North Atlantic SST tripole forced by the NAO in the previous winter as indicated by singular value decomposition (SVD). To isolate the reemerging signal, two additional 60-member ensemble experiments were conducted in which temperature anomalies below 40 m obtained from the SVD analysis are added to or subtracted from the control integration. The reemerging signal, given by the mean difference between the two 60-member ensembles, causes the SST anomaly tripole to recur, beginning in fall, amplifying through January, and persisting through the following spring. The atmospheric response to these SST anomalies resembles the circulation that created them the previous winter but with reduced amplitude (10\&{\#}8211;20 m at 500 mb per {${}^\circ$}C), modestly enhancing the winter-to-winter persistence of the NAO. Changes in the transient eddies and their interactions with the mean flow contribute to the large-scale equivalent barotropic response throughout the troposphere. The latter can also be attributed to the change in occurrence of intrinsic weather regimes. },

@article{Smerdon08,
	Abstract = {The regularized expectation maximization (RegEM) method has been used in recent studies to derive climate field reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the last millennium. Original pseudoproxy experiments that tested RegEM {$[$}with ridge regression regularization (RegEM-Ridge){$]$} standardized the input data in a way that improved the performance of the reconstruction method, but included data from the reconstruction interval for estimates of the mean and standard deviation of the climate field\&{\#}8212;information that is not available in real-world reconstruction problems. When standardizations are confined to the calibration interval only, pseudoproxy reconstructions performed with RegEM-Ridge suffer from warm biases and variance losses. Only cursory explanations of this so-called standardization sensitivity of RegEM-Ridge have been published, but they have suggested that the selection of the regularization (ridge) parameter by means of minimizing the generalized cross validation (GCV) function is the source of the effect. The origin of the standardization sensitivity is more thoroughly investigated herein and is shown not to be associated with the selection of the ridge parameter; sets of derived reconstructions reveal that GCV-selected ridge parameters are minimally different for reconstructions standardized either over both the reconstruction and calibration interval or over the calibration interval only. While GCV may select ridge parameters that are different from those that precisely minimize the error in pseudoproxy reconstructions, RegEM reconstructions performed with truly optimized ridge parameters are not significantly different from those that use GCV-selected ridge parameters. The true source of the standardization sensitivity is attributable to the inclusion or exclusion of additional information provided by the reconstruction interval, namely, the mean and standard deviation fields computed for the complete modeled dataset. These fields are significantly different from those for the calibration period alone because of the violation of a standard EM assumption that missing values are missing at random in typical paleoreconstruction problems; climate data are predominantly missing in the preinstrumental period when the mean climate was significantly colder than the mean of the instrumental period. The origin of the standardization sensitivity therefore is not associated specifically with RegEM-Ridge, and more recent attempts to regularize the EM algorithm using truncated total least squares could theoretically also be susceptible to the problems affecting RegEM-Ridge. Nevertheless, the principal failure of RegEM-Ridge arises because of a poor initial estimate of the mean field, and therefore leaves open the possibility that alternative methods may perform better. },

	Abstract = {We quantify the influence of environmental processes on measurements of seafloor heat flux with a new one-dimensional thermal model that includes time-varying sedimentation and boundary conditions, represents several scales of hydrothermal and transient conductive processes within basement, and allows fluid seepage through accumulating sediments. Variations in basement thermal conductivity, the extent of hydrothermal mixing in upper basement, and fluid seepage through sediments each influence seafloor heat flux by ‚{\"A}{\"o}√¢¬{\ss}2--8{\%}. Conductive thermal rebound following the cessation of advective heat loss from the crust may lower seafloor heat flux values by ‚{\"A}{\"o}√¢‚{\"A}¢5--10{\%}, even after several to several tens of million years. The new models indicate that thermal rebound takes much longer than suggested by earlier (analytical) calculations, mainly because earlier models did not account for the heat capacitance of the conductive lithosphere. Application of the new model to 3.5--3.6 Ma seafloor on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge suggests that anomalously low heat flux in this area is best explained by incomplete conductive thermal rebound in the last 100--200 ka, following the burial of numerous basement outcrops. Application of the new model to the eastern flank of the East Pacific Rise and extrapolation out to the age of some of the oldest remaining seafloor indicate that sedimentation corrections may be important even where accumulation rates are typical of global values. Model results also suggest that conductive thermal rebound through thick sediments may bias measurements made on moderate to old seafloor, even where there is little evidence at present for ridge-flank hydrothermal circulation.},

	Abstract = {Studies of climate variability often rely on high quality sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Although the high-resolution National Centers for Environmental Prediction (formerly the National Meteorological Center) optimum interpolation (OI) SST analysis is satisfactory for these studies, the OI resolution cannot be maintained before November 1931 due to the lack of satellite data. Longer periods of SSTs have come from traditional analyses of in situ (ship and buoy) SST observations alone. A new interpolation method is developed using spatial patterns from empirical orthogonal functions (E0Fs)\&{\#}8212;that is, a principal component analysis\&{\#}8212;to improve analyses of SST anomalies from 1950 to 1981. The method uses the more accurate OI analyses from 1982 to 1993 to produce the spatial EOFs. The dominant EOF modes (which correspond to the largest variance) are used as basis functions and are fit, in a least squares sense, to the in situ data to determine the time dependence of each mode. A complete field of SST anomalies is then reconstructed from these spatial and temporal modes. The use of EOF basis functions produces an improved in situ SST analysis that more realistically represents sparsely sampled, large-scale structures than traditional analyses. The EOF reconstruction method is developed for the tropical Pacific for the period 1982\&{\#}8211;92 and compared to the OI. The method is then expanded to the globe and applied to a much longer period, 1950\&{\#}8211;92. The results show that the reconstructed fields generally have lower rms differences than the traditional in-situ-only analyses relative to the OI. In addition, the reconstructed fields were found to be smoother than the traditional analyses but with enhanced large-scale signals (e.g., ENSO). Regions where traditional analyses are adequate include some parts of the North Atlantic and the North Pacific, where in situ sampling is most dense. Although the shape of SST anomaly patterns can differ greatly between the reconstruction and traditional in situ analysis, area-averaged results from both analyses show similar anomalies. },

Recent theoretical studies have predicted such a pattern as a response of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system to an exogenous heating of the tropical atmosphere. This pattern, however, is not reproduced by the complex ocean-atmosphere circulation models currently used to simulate the climatic response to increased greenhouse gases. Its presence is likely to lessen the mean 20th-century global temperature change in model simulations.},

We propose enhanced, Markov chain Monte Carlo based methods for obtaining age models from radiocarbon-dated peat cores, based on the assumption of piecewise linear accumulation. Included are automatic choice of sections, a measure of the goodness of fit and outlier downweighting. The approach is illustrated by using a peat core from the Netherlands.},

	Abstract = {Distribution sampling from sequences of radiocarbon ages is used to obtain confidence intervals for intermediate age estimates, sediment deposition times, and thence pollen deposition rates. Three types of age-depth model are explored by this approach, and it is demonstrated that the choice of model has implications for confidence intervals on the results. Line-fitting of polynomials by least- squares will produce narrower confidence intervals than interpolation models. It is shown that radiocarbon ages should be evenly spaced, and that results towards the ends of sequences have wider confidence intervals. Of the total width of confidence intervals for pollen deposition rates, up to half may be due to the uncertainties associated with the sediment deposition time, even in uniform sediment. The importance of including confidence intervals of all values as an essential part of the presentation of palaeoecological data is stressed.},

	Abstract = {Radiocarbon dating of bulk sediments has been the standard method for establishing chronologies in the studies of lake sediment cores which have contributed significantly to our knowledge of late Quaternary paleo-environments. These bulk sediment dates are presumed to be direct ageindicators for the speciments (e.g., pollen or macrofossils) which are actually being studied. However, several recent studies have reinforced long-standing apprehensions concerning this presumption. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the radiocarbon dating of pollen concentrate samples by accelerator mass spectrometry. The dates obtained by this method should provide more reliable radiocarbon chronologies for paleo-environmental studies than have been obtainable by bulk sediment dating.},

@article{balco2009,
	Abstract = {The major uncertainty in relating cosmogenic-nuclide exposure ages to ages measured by other dating methods comes from extrapolating nuclide production rates measured at globally scattered calibration sites to the sites of unknown age that are to be dated. This uncertainty can be reduced by locating production rate calibration sites that are similar in location and age to the sites to be dated. We use this strategy to reconcile exposure age and radiocarbon deglaciation chronologies for northeastern North America by compiling {10Be} production rate calibration measurements from independently dated late-glacial and early Holocene ice-marginal landforms in this region. {10Be} production rates measured at these sites are 6--12\% lower than predicted by the commonly accepted global {10Be} calibration data set used with any published production rate scaling scheme. In addition, the regional calibration data set shows significantly less internal scatter than the global calibration data set. Thus, this calibration data set can be used to improve both the precision and accuracy of exposure dating of regional late-glacial events. For example, if the global calibration data set is used to calculate exposure ages, the exposure-age deglaciation chronology for central New England is inconsistent with the deglaciation chronology inferred from radiocarbon dating and varve stratigraphy. We show that using the regional data set instead makes the exposure age and radiocarbon chronologies consistent. This increases confidence in correlating exposure ages of ice-marginal landforms in northeastern North America with glacial and climate events dated by other means.},

	Abstract = {An abrupt cooling event in the North Atlantic region 8,200 years ago affected climate throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The event is well constrained in Greenland ice cores, but lack of resolution in records from other regions has challenged our understanding of the timing and nature of the associated teleconnections. Speleothem records from East Asia have suggested monsoonal changes associated with the 8,200 year event, but the nature of these changes remains controversial. Here we assess changes in East Asian precipitation during the event from a sub-annually resolved stalagmite record from central China. Using {$\delta^{18}${O}} and {Mg/Ca} measurements of the speleothem carbonate, we show that climate dried significantly about 8,200 years ago. Based on our annual-layer-counted chronology, we show that the dry event lasted 150 years, with a central period of pronounced aridity that lasted 70 years. The duration and evolution of the event is indistinguishable from that observed in the Greenland ice cores. We therefore conclude that an effective and rapid atmospheric teleconnection exists between the North Atlantic and the monsoon system in warm climates similar to today's.},

@article{auestad2008,
	Abstract = {The problem of aligning time series arises naturally in a number of fields, but our investigation is motivated by the problem of extracting a paleoclimatic signal from glacial varve chronologies. Glacial varves are laminated sediments that record annual depositional cycles in certain lakes that are fed by glaciers. Varve thickness is determined by temperature and to a lesser extent by precipitation so that an accurate reconstruction of varve chronologies can be regarded as providing a potential long term proxy for paleoclimate. An important aspect of the varve problem is to align series from different locations. What makes the alignment problem particularly interesting is that in either series, one or more varves may be missing or a single varve might have been mistaken for a pair of {varves.Traditionally}, alignment problems have been treated using linear methods and concepts such as coherency and cross correlation. Since one of the pairs of varve series we look at is not well described by a linear model, in this paper we also employ nonlinear criteria that are derived from recent work on nonlinear identification and dependence modeling. More precisely, we use nonlinear least squares and measures of dependence such as the {Kullback---Leibler} measure and the Hellinger distance. Both local and global alignment are considered, and in particular we treat the situation where one or more observations may be missing from either series. Properties of the criteria are given and illustrated by simulation. We display examples where linear methods fail, but nonlinear criteria work. For the real data set of varves at our disposal, it will be seen that the nonlinear criteria perform as well as (or better than) the linear ones for the linearly related series, and that only the nonlinear criteria work for the two series that are not linearly related.

@article{mckay2009,
	Abstract = {Evidence from lake sediments and glacier forefields from two hydrologically isolated lake basins is used to reconstruct Holocene glacier and climate history at Hallet and Greyling Lakes in the central Chugach Mountains of south-central Alaska. Glacial landform mapping, lichenometry, and equilibrium-line altitude reconstructions, along with changes in sedimentary biogenic-silica content, bulk density, and grain-size distribution indicate a dynamic history of Holocene climate variability. The evidence suggests a warm early Holocene from 10 to 6 ka, followed by the onset of Neoglaciation in the two drainage basins, beginning between 4.5 and 4.0 ka. During the past 2 ka, the glacial landforms and lacustrine sediments from the two valleys record a remarkably similar history of glaciation, with two primary advances, one during the first millennium {AD}, from {\textasciitilde}500 to 800 {AD}, and the second during the Little Ice Age ({LIA)} from {\textasciitilde}1400 to 1900 {AD.} During the {LIA}, the reconstructed equilibrium-line altitude in the region was no more than 83 $\pm$ 44 m (n = 21) lower than the modern, which is based on the extent of glaciers during 1978. Differences between the summer temperature inferred from the biogenic-silica content and the evidence for glacial advances and retreats suggest a period of increased winter precipitation from 1300 to 1500 {AD}, and reduced winter precipitation from 1800 to 1900 {AD}, likely associated with variability in the strength of the Aleutian Low.},

	Abstract = {High-resolution, quantitative temperature records are valuable for placing recent warming in the context of long-term, natural climate variability. Here we use biogenic silica ({BSi)} concentrations preserved in lacustrine sediment from an oligotrophic lake to quantitatively reconstruct air temperature at Hallet Lake in south-central Alaska. Mean June through August temperature measured over the past 80 yr at Valdez (Alaska) correlate with {BSi} from Hallet Lake (r = 0.87, p = 0.01). We chose a nested function to model the non-linear relation between summer temperature and {BSi} in the calibration data set, and to reconstruct temperature for the past 2 ka. Our {BSi-inferred} temperature reconstruction shows synchronous changes with independent paleoclimatic proxies for southern Alaska, and provides evidence for a greater rate and magnitude of 20th century temperature warming at Hallet Lake than recorded by other quantitative temperature proxies in the region.},

	Abstract = {Earth's climate history is often understood by breaking it down into constituent climatic epochs1. Over the Common Era (the past 2,000 years) these epochs, such as the Little Ice Age2--4, have been characterized as having occurred at the same time across extensive spatial scales5. Although the rapid global warming seen in observations over the past 150 years does show nearly global coherence6, the spatiotemporal coherence of climate epochs earlier in the Common Era has yet to be robustly tested. Here we use global palaeoclimate reconstructions for the past 2,000 years, and find no evidence for preindustrial globally coherent cold and warm epochs. In particular, we find that the coldest epoch of the last millennium---the putative Little Ice Age---is most likely to have experienced the coldest temperatures during the fifteenth century in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, during the seventeenth century in northwestern Europe and southeastern North America, and during the mid-nineteenth century over most of the remaining regions. Furthermore, the spatial coherence that does exist over the preindustrial Common Era is consistent with the spatial coherence of stochastic climatic variability. This lack of spatiotemporal coherence indicates that preindustrial forcing was not sufficient to produce globally synchronous extreme temperatures at multidecadal and centennial timescales. By contrast, we find that the warmest period of the past two millennia occurred during the twentieth century for more than 98 per cent of the globe. This provides strong evidence that anthropogenic global warming is not only unparalleled in terms of absolute temperatures5, but also unprecedented in spatial consistency within the context of the past 2,000 years.},

	Abstract = {Multidecadal surface temperature changes may be forced by natural as well as anthropogenic factors, or arise unforced from the climate system. Distinguishing these factors is essential for estimating sensitivity to multiple climatic forcings and the amplitude of the unforced variability. Here we present 2,000-year-long global mean temperature reconstructions using seven different statistical methods that draw from a global collection of temperature-sensitive palaeoclimate records. Our reconstructions display synchronous multidecadal temperature fluctuations that are coherent with one another and with fully forced millennial model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 across the Common Era. A substantial portion of pre-industrial (1300--1800 ce) variability at multidecadal timescales is attributed to volcanic aerosol forcing. Reconstructions and simulations qualitatively agree on the amplitude of the unforced global mean multidecadal temperature variability, thereby increasing confidence in future projections of climate change on these timescales. The largest warming trends at timescales of 20 years and longer occur during the second half of the twentieth century, highlighting the unusual character of the warming in recent decades.},

	Abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

@article{GillPleistocene2009,
	Abstract = {Although the North American megafaunal extinctions and the formation of novel plant communities are well-known features of the last deglaciation, the causal relationships between these phenomena are unclear. Using the dung fungus Sporormiella and other paleoecological proxies from Appleman Lake, Indiana, and several New York sites, we established that the megafaunal decline closely preceded enhanced fire regimes and the development of plant communities that have no modern analogs. The loss of keystone megaherbivores may thus have altered ecosystem structure and function by the release of palatable hardwoods from herbivory pressure and by fuel accumulation. Megafaunal populations collapsed from 14,800 to 13,700 years ago, well before the final extinctions and during the B{\o}lling-Aller{\o}d warm period. Human impacts remain plausible, but the decline predates Younger Dryas cooling and the extraterrestrial impact event proposed to have occurred 12,900 years ago.},

	Abstract = {The 100,000-year timescale in the glacial/interglacial cycles of the late Pleistocene epoch (the past ∼700,000 years) is commonly attributed to control by variations in the Earth's orbit1. This hypothesis has inspired models that depend on the Earth's obliquity (∼40,000 yr; ∼40 kyr), orbital eccentricity (∼100 kyr) and precessional (∼20 kyr) fluctuations2,3,4,5, with the emphasis usually on eccentricity and precessional forcing. According to a contrasting hypothesis, the glacial cycles arise primarily because of random internal climate variability6,7,8. Taking these two perspectives together, there are currently more than thirty different models of the seven late-Pleistocene glacial cycles9. Here we present a statistical test of the orbital forcing hypothesis, focusing on the rapid deglaciation events known as terminations10,11. According to our analysis, the null hypothesis that glacial terminations are independent of obliquity can be rejected at the 5{\%} significance level, whereas the corresponding null hypotheses for eccentricity and precession cannot be rejected. The simplest inference consistent with the test results is that the ice sheets terminated every second or third obliquity cycle at times of high obliquity, similar to the original proposal by Milankovitch12. We also present simple stochastic and deterministic models that describe the timing of the late-Pleistocene glacial terminations purely in terms of obliquity forcing.},

	Abstract = {Paleoclimatic time series are often unevenly spaced in time, making it difficult to obtain an accurate estimate of their red-noise spectrum. A Fortran 90 program (REDFIT) is presented that overcomes this problem by fitting a first-order autoregressive (AR1) process, being characteristic for many climatic processes, directly to unevenly spaced time series. Hence, interpolation in the time domain and its inevitable bias can be avoided. The program can be used to test if peaks in the spectrum of a time series are significant against the red-noise background from an AR1 process. Generated and paleoclimatic time series are used to demonstrate the capability of the program.},

Here we introduce a statistical, hierarchical emergent constraint (HEC) framework in order to link future and current climates with observations. Under Gaussian assumptions, the mean and variance of the future state are shown analytically to be a function of the signal-to-noise ratio between current climate uncertainty and observation error and the correlation between future and current climate states. We apply the HEC to the climate change, snow-albedo feedback, which is related to the seasonal cycle in the Northern Hemisphere. We obtain a snow-albedo feedback prediction interval of (?1.25,?0.58){\%}/K. The critical dependence on signal-to-noise ratio and correlation shows that neglecting these terms can lead to bias and underestimated uncertainty in constrained projections. The flexibility of using HEC under general assumptions throughout the Earth system is discussed.},

@article{HoffertCovey:1992,
	Abstract = {To assess the future impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gases on global climate, we need a reliable estimate of the sensitivity of the Earth's climate to changes in radiative forcing. Climate sensitivity is conventionally defined as the equilibrium surface temperature increase for carbon dioxide doubling, ΔT2x. Uncertainties in cloud processes spread general circulation model (GCM) estimates of this parameter over the range 1.5< ΔT2x <4.5$\,^{\circ}$C (refs 1, 2). An alternative to model-based estimates is in principle available from the reconstruction of past climates3--6, which implicitly includes cloud feedback. Here we retrieve the sensitivity of two palaeoclimates, one colder and one warmer than present, by independently reconstructing both the equilibrium surface tem-perature change and the radiative forcing. Our results yield ΔT2x = 2.3 $\pm$0.9 $\,^{\circ}$C. This range is comparable with estimates from GCMs and inferences from recent temperature observations and ocean models7,8. Future application of the method to additional climates in the geological record might constrain climate sensitivity enough to narrow the model uncertainties of global warming predictions.},

@article{Kohler:2010,
	Abstract = {The temperature on Earth varied largely in the Pleistocene from cold glacials to interglacials of different warmths. To contribute to an understanding of the underlying causes of these changes we compile various environmental records (and model-based interpretations of some of them) in order to calculate the direct effect of various processes on Earth's radiative budget and, thus, on global annual mean surface temperature over the last 800,000 years. The importance of orbital variations, of the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O, of the albedo of land ice sheets, annual mean snow cover, sea ice area and vegetation, and of the radiative perturbation of mineral dust in the atmosphere are investigated. Altogether we can explain with these processes a global cooling of 3.9$\pm$0.8K in the equilibrium temperature for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) directly from the radiative budget using only the Planck feedback that parameterises the direct effect on the radiative balance, but neglecting other feedbacks such as water vapour, cloud cover, and lapse rate. The unaccounted feedbacks and related uncertainties would, if taken at present day feedback strengths, decrease the global temperature at the LGM by −8.0$\pm$1.6K. Increased Antarctic temperatures during the Marine Isotope Stages 5.5, 7.5, 9.3 and 11.3 are in our conceptual approach difficult to explain. If compared with other studies, such as PMIP2, this gives supporting evidence that the feedbacks themselves are not constant, but depend in their strength on the mean climate state. The best estimate and uncertainty for our reconstructed radiative forcing and LGM cooling support a present day equilibrium climate sensitivity (excluding the ice sheet and vegetation components) between 1.4 and 5.2K, with a most likely value near 2.4K, somewhat smaller than other methods but consistent with the consensus range of 2--4.5K derived from other lines of evidence. Climate sensitivities above 6K are difficult to reconcile with Last Glacial Maximum reconstructions.},

The Dye 3 temperature is similar to the GRIP history but has an amplitude 1.5 times larger, indicating higher climatic variability there.

	Abstract = {Ground surface temperature (GST) reconstructions determined from temperature profiles measured in terrestrial boreholes, when averaged over the Northern Hemisphere, estimate a surface warming of $\backslash${\&}{\{}$\backslash${\#}{\}}8764;1 K during the interval AD 1500$\backslash${\&}{\{}$\backslash${\#}{\}}8211;2000. Other traditional proxy-based estimates suggest less warming during the same interval. Mann et al. [2003a] have raised two issues with regard to borehole-based reconstructions. The first focuses on the need for spatial gridding and area-weighting of the ensemble of borehole-based GST reconstructions to yield an average hemispheric reconstruction. The second asserts that application of optimal detection techniques show that the GST only weakly displays the spatial structure of the surface air temperature (SAT). We demonstrate the consistency of GST warming estimates by showing that over a wide range of grid element area and occupancy weighting schemes, the five-century GST change falls in the range of 0.89{\&}{\#}8211;1.05 K. We examine the subhemispheric spatial correlation of GST and SAT trends at various spatial scales. In the 5-degree grid employed for optimal detection, we find that the majority of grid element means are determined from three or fewer boreholes, a number that is insufficient to suppress site-specific noise via ensemble averaging. Significant spatial correlation between SAT and GST emerges in a 5-degree grid if low-occupancy grid elements are excluded, and also in a 30-degree grid in which grid element means are better determined through higher occupancy. Reconstructions assembled after excluding low-occupancy grid elements show a five-century GST change in the range of 1.02{\&}{\#}8211;1.06 K.},

	N2 = {Abstract Reconstructions of temperature and hydrology from lake sedimentary archives have made fundamental contributions to our understanding of past, present, and future climate and help evaluate general circulation models (GCMs). However, because paleoclimate observations are an indirect (proxy) constraint on climatic variables, confounding effects of proxy processes complicate interpretations of these archives. To circumvent these uncertainties inherent to paleoclimate data-model comparison, proxy system models (PSMs) provide transfer functions between climate variables and the proxy. We here present a new PSM for lacustrine sedimentary archives. The model simulates lake energy and water balance, sensors including leaf wax δD and carbonate $\delta^{18}${O}, bioturbation, and compaction of sediment to lend insight toward how these processes affect and potentially obfuscate the original climate signal. The final product integrates existing and new models to yield a comprehensive, modular, adaptable, and publicly available PSM for lake systems. Highlighting applications of the PSM, we forward model lake variables with GCM simulations of the last glacial maximum and the modern. The simulations are evaluated with a focus on sensitivity of lake surface temperature and mixing to climate forcing, using Lakes Tanganyika and Malawi as case studies. The PSM highlights the importance of mixing on interpretations of air temperature reconstructions from lake archives and demonstrates how changes in mixing depth alone may induce nonstationarity between in situ lake and air temperatures. By placing GCM output in the same reference frame as lake paleoclimate archives, we aim to improve interpretations of past changes in terrestrial temperatures and water cycling.},

	Abstract = {Uncertainties in projections of future climate change have not lessened substantially in past decades. Both models and observations yield broad probability distributions for long-term increases in global mean temperature expected from the doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, with small but finite probabilities of very large increases. We show that the shape of these probability distributions is an inevitable and general consequence of the nature of the climate system, and we derive a simple analytic form for the shape that fits recent published distributions very well. We show that the breadth of the distribution and, in particular, the probability of large temperature increases are relatively insensitive to decreases in uncertainties associated with the underlying climate processes.},

	N2 = {Abstract Understanding the mechanisms behind any changes in the climate system often requires establishing the timing of events imprinted on the geological record. However, these proxy records are prone to large uncertainties, which may preclude meaningful conclusions about the relative timing of events. In this study, we put forth a framework to estimate the uncertainty in phase relationships inferred from marine sedimentary records. The novelty of our method lies in the accounting of the various sources of uncertainty inherent to paleoclimate reconstruction and timing analysis. Specifically, we use a Monte Carlo process allowing sampling of possible realizations of the time series as functions of uncertainties in time, the climate proxy, and the identification of the termination timing. We then apply this technique to 15 published sea surface temperature records from the equatorial Pacific to evaluate whether we observed any significant changes in the termination timing between the east and the west. We find that the uncertainty on the relative timing estimates is on the order of several thousand years and mainly stems from age model uncertainty (90{\%}). However, even small differences in mean termination timings can be detected with a sufficiently large number of samples. Improvements in the dating of sediment records provide an opportunity to reduce uncertainty in studies of this kind.},

Owing to different model performances against observations and the lack of independence among models, there is now evidence that giving equal weight to each available model projection is suboptimal. This Perspective discusses newly developed tools that facilitate a more rapid and comprehensive evaluation of model simulations with observations, process-based emergent constraints that are a promising way to focus evaluation on the observations most relevant to climate projections, and advanced methods for model weighting. These approaches are needed to distil the most credible information on regional climate changes, impacts, and risks for stakeholders and policy-makers.},

The historical ECS estimates range from 1.5$\,^{\circ}$to 3$\,^{\circ}$C and are derived assuming a linear radiative response to warming. A Bayesian methodology applied to 24 models, however, documents curvature in the radiative response to warming from an evolving contribution of interannual to centennial modes of radiative response. Centennial modes display stronger amplifying feedbacks and ultimately contribute 28 to 68{\%} (90{\%} credible interval) of equilibrium warming, yet they comprise only 1 to 7{\%} of current warming. Accounting for these unresolved centennial contributions brings historical records into agreement with model-derived ECS estimates.},

	Abstract = {Reconstructions of Earth's past climate strongly influence our understanding of the dynamics and sensitivity of the climate system. Yet global temperature has been reconstructed for only a few isolated windows of time, and continuous reconstructions across glacial cycles remain elusive. Here I present a spatially weighted proxy reconstruction of global temperature over the past 2 million years estimated from a multi-proxy database of over 20,000 sea surface temperature point reconstructions. Global temperature gradually cooled until roughly 1.2 million years ago and cooling then stalled until the present. The cooling trend probably stalled before the beginning of the mid-Pleistocene transition, and pre-dated the increase in the maximum size of ice sheets around 0.9 million years ago. Thus, global cooling may have been a pre-condition for, but probably is not the sole causal mechanism of, the shift to quasi-100,000-year glacial cycles at the mid-Pleistocene transition. Over the past 800,000 years, polar amplification (the amplification of temperature change at the poles relative to global temperature change) has been stable over time, and global temperature and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have been closely coupled across glacial cycles. A comparison of the new temperature reconstruction with radiative forcing from greenhouse gases estimates an Earth system sensitivity of 9 degrees Celsius (range 7 to 13 degrees Celsius, 95 per cent credible interval) change in global average surface temperature per doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide over millennium timescales. This result suggests that stabilization at today's greenhouse gas levels may already commit Earth to an eventual total warming of 5 degrees Celsius (range 3 to 7 degrees Celsius, 95 per cent credible interval) over the next few millennia as ice sheets, vegetation and atmospheric dust continue to respond to global warming.},

	Abstract = {Assessing the impact of future anthropogenic carbon emissions is currently impeded by uncertainties in our knowledge of equilibrium climate sensitivity to atmospheric carbon dioxide doubling. Previous studies suggest 3 kelvin (K) as the best estimate, 2 to 4.5 K as the 66% probability range, and nonzero probabilities for much higher values, the latter implying a small chance of high-impact climate changes that would be difficult to avoid. Here, combining extensive sea and land surface temperature reconstructions from the Last Glacial Maximum with climate model simulations, we estimate a lower median (2.3 K) and reduced uncertainty (1.7 to 2.6 K as the 66% probability range, which can be widened using alternate assumptions or data subsets). Assuming that paleoclimatic constraints apply to the future, as predicted by our model, these results imply a lower probability of imminent extreme climatic change than previously thought.},

In this study, Monte Carlo simulations are used to investigate the suitability of two commonly used noise hypotheses (the ?conventional? and ?robust? AR1 approaches), and the results highlight important limitations in both for cyclostratigraphic application. Perhaps most problematic, the robust AR1 method can result in inflated confidence level estimates and excessive clumping of false positives within the low frequency portion of the spectrum, especially when the underlying noise process has a high lag-1 autocorrelation. Given typical cyclostratigraphic records, this technique will often impose ?significant? eccentricity band variability, even in the case of pure AR1 noise. An alternative spectral noise estimation method is proposed to overcome these problems, which simultaneously allows for departures from the AR1 assumption, and obtains high statistical power?that is, the ability to accurately identify astronomical signals when they are present in the data. We apply the method to un-tuned{\^I}´18O data from Miocene sediments of the Ceara Rise, indicating statistically significant spectral power at frequencies that are consistent with the published orbital interpretation of Weedon et al. (1997). Furthermore, evaluation of the frequency arrangement of the significant spatial bedding periods, using the average spectral misfit method for astrochronologic testing, reveals that the null hypothesis of no orbital influence can be rejected with a high degree of confidence (the 99.8{\%} confidence level).},

	Abstract = {Traditional approaches to ontology development have a large lapse between the time when a user using the ontology has found a need to extend it and the time when it does get extended. For scientists, this delay can be weeks or months and can be a significant barrier for adoption. We present a new approach to ontology development and data annotation enabling users to add new metadata properties on the fly as they describe their datasets, creating terms that can be immediately adopted by others and eventually become standardized. This approach combines a traditional, consensus-based approach to ontology development, and a crowdsourced approach where expert users (the crowd) can dynamically add terms as needed to support their work. We have implemented this approach as a socio-technical system that includes: (1) a crowdsourcing platform to support metadata annotation and addition of new terms, (2) a range of social editorial processes to make standardization decisions for those new terms, and (3) a framework for ontology revision and updates to the metadata created with the previous version of the ontology. We present a prototype implementation for the Paleoclimate community, the Linked Earth Framework, currently containing 700 datasets and engaging over 50 active contributors. Users exploit the platform to do science while extending the metadata vocabulary, thereby producing useful and practical metadata.},

	Abstract = {The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the leading mode of interannual climate variability. However, it is unclear how ENSO has responded to external forcing, particularly orbitally induced changes in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle during the Holocene. Here we present a reconstruction of seasonal and interannual surface conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean from a network of high-resolution coral and mollusc records that span discrete intervals of the Holocene. We identify several intervals of reduced variance in the 2 to 7{$[$}thinsp{$]$}yr ENSO band that are not in phase with orbital changes in equatorial insolation, with a notable 64{\%} reduction between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago. We compare the reconstructed ENSO variance and seasonal cycle with that simulated by nine climate models that include orbital forcing, and find that the models do not capture the timing or amplitude of ENSO variability, nor the mid-Holocene increase in seasonality seen in the observations; moreover, a simulated inverse relationship between the amplitude of the seasonal cycle and ENSO-related variance in sea surface temperatures is not found in our reconstructions. We conclude that the tropical Pacific climate is highly variable and subject to millennial scale quiescent periods. These periods harbour no simple link to orbital forcing, and are not adequately simulated by the current generation of models.},

@article{Liang:2013,
	Abstract = {Information flow, or information transfer as it may be referred to, is a fundamental notion in general physics which has wide applications in scientific disciplines. Recently, a rigorous formalism has been established with respect to both deterministic and stochastic systems, with flow measures explicitly obtained. These measures possess some important properties, among which is flow or transfer asymmetry. The formalism has been validated and put to application with a variety of benchmark systems, such as the baker transformation, H{\'e}non map, truncated Burgers-Hopf system, Langevin equation, etc. In the chaotic Burgers-Hopf system, all the transfers, save for one, are essentially zero, indicating that the processes underlying a dynamical phenomenon, albeit complex, could be simple. (Truth is simple.) In the Langevin equation case, it is found that there could be no information flowing from one certain time series to another series, though the two are highly correlated. Information flow/transfer provides a potential measure of the cause--effect relation between dynamical events, a relation usually hidden behind the correlation in a traditional sense.},

@article{shuman_millennial--centennial_2017,
	Abstract = {A synthesis of 93 hydrologic records from across North and Central America, and adjacent tropical and Arctic islands, reveals centennial to millennial trends in the regional hydroclimates of the Common Era (CE; past 2000 years). The hydrological records derive from materials stored in lakes, bogs, caves, and ice from extant glaciers, which have the continuity through time to preserve low-frequency ({\textgreater} 100 year) climate signals that may not be well represented by other shorter-lived archives, such as tree-ring chronologies. The most common pattern, represented in 46 (49 \%) of the records, indicates that the centuries before 1000 CE were drier than the centuries since that time. Principal components analysis indicates that millennial-scale trends represent the dominant pattern of variance in the southwest and northeast U.S., the mid-continent, Pacific Northwest, the Arctic, and the tropics, although not all records within a region show the same direction of change. The Pacific Northwest, Greenland, and the southernmost tier of the tropical sites tended to dry toward present, as many other areas became wetter than before. Twenty-two records (24 \%) indicate that the Medieval period (800--1300 CE) was drier than the Little Ice Age (1400--1900 CE), but in many cases the difference was part of the longer millennial-scale trend, and, in 25 records (27 \%), the Medieval period represented a pluvial (wet) phase. Where quantitative records permitted a comparison, we found that centennial-scale fluctuations over the Common Era represented changes of 3--7 \% of the modern inter-annual range of variability in precipitation, but the accumulation of these long-term trends over the entirety of the Holocene caused recent centuries to be significantly wetter, on average, than most of the past 11 000 years.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The mid-Holocene (6000 years ago) is a standard experiment for the evaluation of the simulated response of global climate models using paleoclimate reconstructions. The latest mid-Holocene simulations are a contribution by the Palaeoclimate Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP4) to the current phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Here we provide an initial analysis and evaluation of the results of the experiment for the mid-Holocene. We show that state-of-the-art models produce climate changes that are broadly consistent with theory and observations, including increased summer warming of the northern hemisphere and associated shifts in tropical rainfall. Many features of the PMIP4-CMIP6 simulations were present in the previous generation (PMIP3-CMIP5) of simulations. The PMIP4-CMIP6 ensemble for the mid-Holocene has a global mean temperature change of \&minus;0.3\&thinsp;K, which is \&minus;0.2\&thinsp;K cooler that the PMIP3-CMIP5 simulations predominantly as a result of the prescription of realistic greenhouse gas concentrations in PMIP4-CMIP6. Neither this difference nor the improvement in model complexity and resolution seems to improve the realism of the simulations. Biases in the magnitude and the sign of regional responses identified in PMIP3-CMIP5, such as the amplification of the northern African monsoon, precipitation changes over Europe and simulated aridity in mid-Eurasia, are still present in the PMIP4-CMIP6 simulations. Despite these issues, PMIP4-CMIP6 and the mid-Holocene provide an opportunity both for quantitative evaluation and derivation of emergent constraints on climate sensitivity and feedback strength.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {Structural differences among models account for much of the uncertainty in projected climate changes, at least until the mid-twenty-first century. Recent observations encompass too limited a range of climate variability to provide a robust test of the ability to simulate climate changes. Past climate changes provide a unique opportunity for out-of-sample evaluation of model performance. Palaeo-evaluation has shown that the large-scale changes seen in twenty-first-century projections, including enhanced land--sea temperature contrast, latitudinal amplification, changes in temperature seasonality and scaling of precipitation with temperature, are likely to be realistic. Although models generally simulate changes in large-scale circulation sufficiently well to shift regional climates in the right direction, they often do not predict the correct magnitude of these changes. Differences in performance are only weakly related to modern-day biases or climate sensitivity, and more sophisticated models are not better at simulating climate changes. Although models correctly capture the broad patterns of climate change, improvements are required to produce reliable regional projections.},

@article{Guillot_AOAS2015,
	Abstract = {Understanding centennial scale climate variability requires data sets that are accurate, long, continuous and of broad spatial coverage. Since instrumental measurements are generally only available after 1850, temperature fields must be reconstructed using paleoclimate archives, known as proxies. Various climate field reconstructions (CFR) methods have been proposed to relate past temperature to such proxy networks. In this work, we propose a new CFR method, called GraphEM, based on Gaussian Markov random fields embedded within an EM algorithm. Gaussian Markov random fields provide a natural and flexible framework for modeling high-dimensional spatial fields. At the same time, they provide the parameter reduction necessary for obtaining precise and well-conditioned estimates of the covariance structure, even in the sample-starved setting common in paleoclimate applications. In this paper, we propose and compare the performance of different methods to estimate the graphical structure of climate fields, and demonstrate how the GraphEM algorithm can be used to reconstruct past climate variations. The performance of GraphEM is compared to the widely used CFR method RegEM with regularization via truncated total least squares, using synthetic data. Our results show that GraphEM can yield significant improvements, with uniform gains over space, and far better risk properties. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of temperature fields can be well estimated by graphs where each neighbor is only connected to a few geographically close neighbors, and that the increase in performance is directly related to recovering the underlying sparsity in the covariance of the spatial field. Our work demonstrates how significant improvements can be made in climate reconstruction methods by better modeling the covariance structure of the climate field.},

Using networks of these pseudoproxy data, we investigate the sensitivity of CFR performance to signal-to-noise ratios, the noise spectrum, the spatial sampling of pseudoproxy locations, the statistical representation of predictors used, and the diagnostic used to quantify reconstruction skill. Our results reinforce previous conclusions that CFR methods, correctly implemented and applied to suitable networks of proxy data, should yield reliable reconstructions of past climate histories within estimated uncertainties. Our results also demonstrate the deleterious impact of a linear detrending procedure performed recently in certain CFR studies and illustrate flaws in some previously proposed metrics of reconstruction skill.},

	N2 = {Abstract The alkenone?based U proxy is a cornerstone of paleoclimatology, providing insight into the temperature history of the Earth's surface ocean. Although the relationship between U and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is robust and well supported by experimental data, there remain outstanding issues regarding the seasonality of production of alkenones and the response of U at very warm and cold SSTs. Using a data set of over 1,300 core?top U measurements, we find compelling evidence of seasonal production in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Mediterranean Oceans. We also find significant attenuation of the U response to SST at warm temperatures (>24$\,^{\circ}$C), with the slope reduced by nearly 50{\%} as U approaches unity. To account for these observations in a calibration, we develop a new Bayesian B?spline regression model, BAYSPLINE, for the U paleothermometer. BAYSPLINE produces similar estimates as previous calibrations below ?24$\,^{\circ}$, but above this point it predicts larger SST changes, in accordance with the attenuation of the U response. Example applications of BAYSPLINE demonstrate that its treatment of seasonality and slope attenuation improves paleoclimatic interpretations, with important consequences for the inference of SSTs in the tropical oceans. BAYSPLINE facilitates a probabilistic approach to paleoclimate, building upon growing efforts to develop more formalized statistical frameworks for paleoceanographic reconstruction.},

	Abstract = {TEX86 is an important proxy for constraining ocean temperatures in the Earth's past. Current calibrations, however, feature structured residuals indicative of a spatially-varying relationship between TEX86 and sea-surface temperatures (SSTs). Here we develop and apply a Bayesian regression approach to the TEX86--SST calibration that explicitly allows for model parameters to smoothly vary as a function of space, and considers uncertainties in the modern SSTs as well as in the TEX86--SST relationship. The spatially-varying model leads to larger uncertainties at locations that are data-poor, while Bayesian inference naturally propagates calibration uncertainty into the uncertainty in the predictions. Applications to both Quaternary and Eocene TEX86 data demonstrate that our approach produces reasonable results, and improves upon previous methods by allowing for probabilistic assessments of past temperatures. The scientific understanding of TEX86 remains imperfect, and the model presented here allows for predictions that implicitly account for the effects of environmental factors other than SSTs that lead to a spatially non-stationary TEX86--SST relationship.},

@article{Andrews:2015a,
	Abstract = {AbstractExperiments with CO2 instantaneously quadrupled and then held constant are used to show that the relationship between the global-mean net heat input to the climate system and the global-mean surface air temperature change is nonlinear in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) atmosphere?ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). The nonlinearity is shown to arise from a change in strength of climate feedbacks driven by an evolving pattern of surface warming. In 23 out of the 27 AOGCMs examined, the climate feedback parameter becomes significantly (95{\%} confidence) less negative (i.e., the effective climate sensitivity increases) as time passes. Cloud feedback parameters show the largest changes. In the AOGCM mean, approximately 60{\%} of the change in feedback parameter comes from the tropics (30$\,^{\circ}$N?30$\,^{\circ}$S). An important region involved is the tropical Pacific, where the surface warming intensifies in the east after a few decades. The dependence of climate feedbacks on an evolving pattern of surface warming is confirmed using the HadGEM2 and HadCM3 atmosphere GCMs (AGCMs). With monthly evolving sea surface temperatures and sea ice prescribed from its AOGCM counterpart, each AGCM reproduces the time-varying feedbacks, but when a fixed pattern of warming is prescribed the radiative response is linear with global temperature change or nearly so. It is also demonstrated that the regression and fixed-SST methods for evaluating effective radiative forcing are in principle different, because rapid SST adjustment when CO2 is changed can produce a pattern of surface temperature change with zero global mean but nonzero change in net radiation at the top of the atmosphere (\~{}?0.5 W m?2 in HadCM3).},

	Abstract = {Observations and simulations (using the HadCM3 AOGCM) of time-dependent twentieth-century climate change indicate a linear relationship F = rho Delta T between radiative forcing F and global mean surface air temperature change Delta T. The same is a good description of Delta T from CMIP3 AOGCMs integrated with CO2 increasing at 1{\%} per year compounded. The constant "climate resistance'' rho is related to the transient climate response (TCR, Delta DT at the time of doubled CO2 under the 1{\%} CO2 scenario). Disregarding any trend caused by natural forcing (volcanic and solar), which is small compared with the trend in anthropogenic forcing, we estimate that the real-world TCR is 1.3-2.3 K (5-95{\%} uncertainty range) from the data of 1970-2006, allowing for the effect of unforced variability on longer timescales. The climate response to episodic volcanic forcing cannot be described by the same relationship and merits further investigation; this constitutes a systematic uncertainty of the method. The method is quite insensitive to the anthropogenic aerosol forcing, which probably did not vary much during 1970-2006 and therefore did not affect the trend in Delta T. Our range is very similar to the range of recent AOGCM results for the TCR. Consequently projections for warming during the twenty-first century under the SRES A1B emissions scenario made using the simple empirical relationship F = rho Delta T agree with the range of AOGCM results for that scenario. Our TCR range is also similar to those from observationally constrained model-based methods.},

@article{Hasselmann:1997,
	Abstract = {The multi-variate optimal fingerprint method for the detection of an externally forced climate change signal in the presence of natural internal variability is extended to the attribution problem. To determine whether a climate change signal which has been detected in observed climate data can be attributed to a particular climate forcing mechanism, or combination of mechanisms, the predicted space--time dependent climate change signal patterns for the candidate climate forcings must be specified. In addition to the signal patterns, the method requires input information on the space--time dependent covariance matrices of the natural climate variability and of the errors of the predicted signal patterns. The detection and attribution problem is treated as a sequence of individual consistency tests applied to all candidate forcing mechanisms, as well as to the null hypothesis that no climate change has taken place, within the phase space spanned by the predicted climate change patterns. As output the method yields a significance level for the detection of a climate change signal in the observed data and individual confidence levels for the consistency of the retrieved climate change signal with each of the forcing mechanisms. A statistically significant climate change signal is regarded as consistent with a given forcing mechanism if the statistical confidence level exceeds a given critical value, but is attributed to that forcing only if all other candidate climate change mechanisms (from a finite set of proposed mechanisms) are rejected at that confidence level. Although all relations can be readily expressed in standard matrix notation, the analysis is carried out using tensor notation, with a metric given by the natural-variability covariance matrix. This simplifies the derivations and clarifies the invariant relation between the covariant signal patterns and their contravariant fingerprint counterparts. The signal patterns define the reduced vector space in which the climate trajectories are analyzed, while the fingerprints are needed to project the climate trajectories onto this reduced space.},

@article{Stone:AREPS09,
	Abstract = { This article describes the field of the detection and attribution of climate change and highlights recent progress, major issues, and future directions. The attribution of global temperature variations over the past century to a combination of anthropogenic and natural influences is now well established, with the anthropogenic factors dominating. Other aspects of the climate system, including regional quantities, are increasingly being found to also show a detectable signal of human influence. Of particular interest, though, is the attribution of changes in nonmeteorological quantities, such as hydrological and ecological measures, and of changes in the risk of extreme weather events to anthropogenic emissions. Methods are being developed for tackling these two problems but are still in the early stages. As the field gradually includes a service focus, the biggest challenges will become the integration of various approaches into an overall framework and the communication of the capabilities and limitations of that framework to the outside community. },

	N2 = {Abstract Pressure dipoles are important long distance climate phenomena (teleconnection) characterized by pressure anomalies of the opposite polarity appearing at two different locations at the same time. Such dipoles have been proven important for understanding and explaining the variability in climate in many regions of the world, e.g. the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate phenomenon, which is described by opposite pressure anomalies between the west and east Pacific and is known to be responsible for precipitation and temperature anomalies worldwide. This paper presents a graph?based approach called shared reciprocal nearest neighbor approach that considers only reciprocal positive and negative edges in the shared nearest neighbor graph to find the dipoles. One crucial aspect of our approach to the analysis of such networks is a careful treatment of negative correlations, whose proper consideration is critical for finding the dipoles. Further, our work shows the importance of modeling the time?dependent patterns of the dipoles in a changing climate in order to better capture the impact of important climate phenomena on the globe. To show the utility of finding dipoles using our approach, we show that the data driven dynamic climate indices generated from our algorithm generally perform better than static indices formed from the fixed locations used by climate scientists in terms of capturing impact on global temperature and precipitation. Our approach can generate a single snapshot picture of all the dipole interconnections on the globe in a given dataset and thus makes it possible to study the changes in dipole interactions and movements. As teleconnections are crucial in the understanding of the global climate system, there is a pressing need to better understand the behavior and interactions of these atmospheric processes as well as to capture them precisely. Our systematic graph?based approach to find the teleconnections in climate data is an attempt in that direction. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Statistical Analysis and Data Mining 6: 158?179, 2013},

	N2 = {Abstract Climate models are complex mathematical models designed by meteorologists, geophysicists, and climate scientists, and run as computer simulations, to predict climate. There is currently high variance among the predictions of 20 global climate models, from various laboratories around the world, that inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Given temperature predictions from 20 IPCC global climate models, and over 100 years of historical temperature data, we track the changing sequence of which model predicts best at any given time. We use an algorithm due to Monteleoni and Jaakkola that models the sequence of observations using a hierarchical learner, based on a set of generalized Hidden Markov Models, where the identity of the current best climate model is the hidden variable. The transition probabilities between climate models are learned online, simultaneous to tracking the temperature predictions. On historical global mean temperature data, our online learning algorithm's average prediction loss nearly matches that of the best performing climate model in hindsight. Moreover, its performance surpasses that of the average model prediction, which is the default practice in climate science, the median prediction, and least squares linear regression. We also experimented on climate model predictions through the year 2098. Simulating labels with the predictions of any one climate model, we found significantly improved performance using our online learning algorithm with respect to the other climate models and techniques. To complement our global results, we also ran experiments on IPCC global climate model temperature predictions for the specific geographic regions of Africa, Europe, and North America. On historical data, at both annual and monthly time?scales, and in future simulations, our algorithm typically outperformed both the best climate model per region and linear regression. Notably, our algorithm consistently outperformed the average prediction over models, the current benchmark. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Statistical Analysis and Data Mining 4: 372?392, 2011},

	Abstract = {Warming of the oceans and consequent loss of dissolved oxygen (O2) will alter marine ecosystems, but a mechanistic framework to predict the impact of multiple stressors on viable habitat is lacking. Here, we integrate physiological, climatic, and biogeographic data to calibrate and then map a key metabolic index---the ratio of O2 supply to resting metabolic O2 demand---across geographic ranges of several marine ectotherms. These species differ in thermal and hypoxic tolerances, but their contemporary distributions are all bounded at the equatorward edge by a minimum metabolic index of ~2 to 5, indicative of a critical energetic requirement for organismal activity. The combined effects of warming and O2 loss this century are projected to reduce the upper ocean's metabolic index by ~20% globally and by ~50% in northern high-latitude regions, forcing poleward and vertical contraction of metabolically viable habitats and species ranges.},

	Abstract = {AbstractThe authors assess the ability of 18 Earth system models to simulate the land and ocean carbon cycle for the present climate. These models will be used in the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) for climate projections, and such evaluation allows identification of the strengths and weaknesses of individual coupled carbon?climate models as well as identification of systematic biases of the models. Results show that models correctly reproduce the main climatic variables controlling the spatial and temporal characteristics of the carbon cycle. The seasonal evolution of the variables under examination is well captured. However, weaknesses appear when reproducing specific fields: in particular, considering the land carbon cycle, a general overestimation of photosynthesis and leaf area index is found for most of the models, while the ocean evaluation shows that quite a few models underestimate the primary production.The authors also propose climate and carbon cycle performance metrics in order to assess whether there is a set of consistently better models for reproducing the carbon cycle. Averaged seasonal cycles and probability density functions (PDFs) calculated from model simulations are compared with the corresponding seasonal cycles and PDFs from different observed datasets. Although the metrics used in this study allow identification of some models as better or worse than the average, the ranking of this study is partially subjective because of the choice of the variables under examination and also can be sensitive to the choice of reference data. In addition, it was found that the model performances show significant regional variations.},

	Abstract = {The effects of increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and climate on net carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems of the conterminous United States for the period 1895{\textendash}1993 were modeled with new, detailed historical climate information. For the period 1980{\textendash}1993, results from an ensemble of three models agree within 25\%, simulating a land carbon sink from CO2 and climate effects of 0.08 gigaton of carbon per year. The best estimates of the total sink from inventory data are about three times larger, suggesting that processes such as regrowth on abandoned agricultural land or in forests harvested before 1980 have effects as large as or larger than the direct effects of CO2 and climate. The modeled sink varies by about 100\% from year to year as a result of climate variability.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of seawater provides valuable insight on ocean circulation, air‐sea exchange, the biological pump, and the global carbon cycle and is reflected by the δ13C of foraminifera tests. Here more than 1700 δ13C observations of the benthic foraminifera genus Cibicides from late Holocene sediments (δ13CCibnat) are compiled and compared with newly updated estimates of the natural (preindustrial) water column δ13C of dissolved inorganic carbon (δ13CDICnat) as part of the international Ocean Circulation and Carbon Cycling (OC3) project. Using selection criteria based on the spatial distance between samples, we find high correlation between δ13CCibnat and δ13CDICnat, confirming earlier work. Regression analyses indicate significant carbonate ion (−2.6 $\pm$ 0.4) × 10−3‰/(μmol kg−1) [CO32−] and pressure (−4.9 $\pm$ 1.7) × 10−5‰ m−1 (depth) effects, which we use to propose a new global calibration for predicting δ13CDICnat from δ13CCibnat. This calibration is shown to remove some systematic regional biases and decrease errors compared with the one‐to‐one relationship (δ13CDICnat = δ13CCibnat). However, these effects and the error reductions are relatively small, which suggests that most conclusions from previous studies using a one‐to‐one relationship remain robust. The remaining standard error of the regression is generally σ ≅ 0.25‰, with larger values found in the southeast Atlantic and Antarctic (σ ≅ 0.4‰) and for species other than Cibicides wuellerstorfi. Discussion of species effects and possible sources of the remaining errors may aid future attempts to improve the use of the benthic δ13C record.},

@article{Stock-John-etal-2017,
	Abstract = {Photosynthesis fuels marine food webs, yet differences in fish catch across globally distributed marine ecosystems far exceed differences in net primary production {(NPP).} We consider the hypothesis that ecosystem-level variations in pelagic and benthic energy flows from phytoplankton to fish, trophic transfer efficiencies, and fishing effort can quantitatively reconcile this contrast in an energetically consistent manner. To test this hypothesis, we enlist global fish catch data that include previously neglected contributions from small-scale fisheries, a synthesis of global fishing effort, and plankton food web energy flux estimates from a prototype high-resolution global earth system model {(ESM).} After removing a small number of lightly fished ecosystems, stark interregional differences in fish catch per unit area can be explained (r = 0.79) with an energy-based model that (i) considers dynamic interregional differences in benthic and pelagic energy pathways connecting phytoplankton and fish, (ii) depresses trophic transfer efficiencies in the tropics and, less critically, (iii) associates elevated trophic transfer efficiencies with benthic-predominant systems. Model catch estimates are generally within a factor of 2 of values spanning two orders of magnitude. Climate change projections show that the same macroecological patterns explaining dramatic regional catch differences in the contemporary ocean amplify catch trends, producing changes that may exceed 50\% in some regions by the end of the 21st century under high-emissions scenarios. Models failing to resolve these trophodynamic patterns may significantly underestimate regional fisheries catch trends and hinder adaptation to climate change.},

Earth system models, which simulate terrestrial and marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, offer a common framework for ecological research related to climate processes; analyses of vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation; and climate change mitigation. They provide an opportunity to move beyond physical descriptors of atmospheric and oceanic states to societally relevant quantities such as wildfire risk, habitat loss, water availability, and crop, fishery, and timber yields. To achieve this, the science of climate prediction must be extended to a more multifaceted Earth system prediction that includes the biosphere and its resources.},

Over the past century, the amplitude of this climate pattern has varied irregularly at interannual-to-interdecadal timescales. There is evidence of reversals in the prevailing polarity of the oscillation occurring around 1925, 1947, and 1977; the last two reversals correspond to dramatic shifts in salmon production regimes in the North Pacific Ocean. This climate pattern also affects coastal sea and continental surface air temperatures, as well as streamflow in major west coast river systems, from Alaska to California.},

@article{burn2015,
	Abstract = {Hurricanes are a persistent socio-economic hazard for countries situated in and around the Main Development Region (MDR) of Atlantic tropical cyclones. Climate-model simulations have attributed their interdecadal variability to changes in solar and volcanic activity, Saharan dust flux, anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions and heat transport within the global ocean conveyor belt. However, the attribution of hurricane activity to specific forcing factors is hampered by the short observational record of Atlantic storms. Here, we present the Extended Hurricane Activity (EHA) index, the first empirical reconstruction of Atlantic tropical cyclone activity for the last millennium, derived from a high-resolution lake sediment geochemical record from Jamaica. The EHA correlates significantly with decadal changes in tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs; r = 0.68; 1854-2008), the Accumulated Cyclone Energy index (ACE; r = 0.90; 1851-2010), and two annually-resolved coral-based SST reconstructions (1773-2008) from within the MDR. Our results corroborate evidence for the increasing trend of hurricane activity during the Industrial Era; however, we show that contemporary activity has not exceeded the range of natural climate variability exhibited during the last millennium.},

@article{palaeosens2012,
	Abstract = {Many palaeoclimate studies have quantified pre-anthropogenic climate change to calculate climate sensitivity (equilibrium temperature change in response to radiative forcing change), but a lack of consistent methodologies produces a wide range of estimates and hinders comparability of results. Here we present a stricter approach, to improve intercomparison of palaeoclimate sensitivity estimates in a manner compatible with equilibrium projections for future climate change. Over the past 65 million years, this reveals a climate sensitivity (in K W(-1) m(2)) of 0.3-1.9 or 0.6-1.3 at 95\% or 68\% probability, respectively. The latter implies a warming of 2.2-4.8 K per doubling of atmospheric CO(2), which agrees with IPCC estimates.},
