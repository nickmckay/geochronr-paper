  Chronological uncertainty is a hallmark of the paleosciences. While many tools have been made available to researchers to produce age models suitable for various settings and assumptions, disparate tools and output formats often discourage integrative approaches. In addition, propagating age model uncertainties to subsequent analyses, and visualizing the results, has received comparatively little attention in the literature and available software. Here we describe GeoChronR, an open-source R package to facilitate these tasks. GeoChronR is built around emerging data standards for the paleosciences (Linked Paleo Data, or LiPD), and offers access to four popular age modeling techniques (Bacon, BChron, Oxcal, BAM). The output of these models is easily stored in LiPD, enabling paleo-aware synchronization, regression, correlation, principal component, and spectral analyses. Five real-world use cases illustrate how to use GeoChronR to facilitate these tasks, and to visualize the results in intuitive ways.

\section*{Background}

Quantifying chronological uncertainties, and how they might influence the understanding of past changes is fundamental to the paleogeosciences. 
Without robust error determination, it is impossible to properly assess the extent to which past changes occurred simultaneously across regions or the duration of abrupt events, both of which limit our capacity to apply paleoscientific understanding to modern and future processes.
The need for better infrastructure to both characterize uncertainty, and to explicitly evaluate how age uncertainty impacts the the interpretation of records of past climate, ecology or landscapes, has been long recognized [@Noren2013, (more)]. 
In response to this need, the paleogeoscience community has made substantial advances toward improving geochronological accuracy by:
1. Improving analytical techniques that allow for more precise age determination on smaller and context-specific samples [@Brown\emph{radiocarbon89,@Eglinton96,@Fifield2000,@Eggins2005,@Santos}blank\_2010]
2. Refining our understanding of how past changes in the Earth system impact the age accuracy, for example: improvements to the radiocarbon calibration curve [@Stuiver91,@Stuiver98,intcal references] and advances in our understanding of spatial variability in cosmogenic production rates used in exposure dating [@Balco2009,Masarik2009]
3. Dramatic improvement in the level of sophistication and realism in age-depth models used to estimate the ages of sequences between dated samples [e.g. @Ramsey2009Bayesian, @parnell2008flexible, @Blaauw2010CLAM, @Blaauw2011BACON].

Over the past 20 years, these advances have been widely adopted in the paleogeosciences. 
However, despite the progress made in quantifying uncertainty in ages and in age models, few studies have formally evaluated how chronological uncertainty may have affected their results. 
For instance, whereas the algorithms presented by [@Ramsey2009Bayesian, @parnell2008flexible, @Blaauw2010CLAM, @Blaauw2011BACON] have been broadly used, the overwhelming majority of these studies calculate the single best-estimate model (often a median or mean), use this model to put measured paleoclimatic or paleoenvironmental data on a timescale, and then proceed to analyze the record with little to no reference to the age modeling exercise citep[e.g.][and many others]\{McKay2008,McKay2009\}. 
Typically, any discussions of chronological uncertainties remain qualitative.

This paradigm is beginning to change. 
In recent years a handful of studies have taken advantage of approaches that generate ensembles of age models to evaluate how the results of their analyses and conclusions vary given differences between ensemble members citep\{Haam\emph{Huybers2010,Rhines}JGR2011,Anchukaitis\emph{Tierney2012,Shakun}Nature2012,Marcott\_Science2013, Tierney2013\}. 
By using each ensemble age model to create a time-uncertain ensemble records, and then carrying that ensemble through the analysis, the precise impact of age uncertainty can be formally evaluated. 
This approach, of course, does not address all aspects of uncertainty, but it does offer the broad potential to ascertain which results are robust to chronological uncertainty, and which are not.

Despite its potential to substantially improve uncertainty quantification for the paleogeosciences, this framework is not widely utilized. 
The majority of studies utilizing this approach have been regional [e.g., @Anchukaitis\emph{Tierney2012,@Tierney2013,@mckay}onset\emph{2018, @routson2018\} or global-scale [e.g., @Shakun}Nature2012,@Marcott\_Science2013,@kaufman2020HoloceneGMST] syntheses.
Occasionally, primary publications of new records incorporate time-unceratin analysis into their studies [@Boldt2015,more], but this remains rare. 
We suggest that there are several reasons for the lack of adoption of these techniques:

\begin{enumerate}
\item For synthesis studies, the necessary geochronological data are not publicly available for the vast majority of records. Even when they are available, the data are archived in diverse and unstructured data formats. Together, this makes what should be a simple process of aggregating and preparing data for analysis prohibitively time-consuming;
\item For studies of new and individual records, few tools for ensemble analysis are available, and those that are require a degree of comfort with coding languages and scientific programming that is rare among paleogeoscientists;
\item There is a disconnect between age-model development and time-uncertain analysis. Published approaches have utilized either simplified age-modeling approaches [@Haam\emph{Huybers2010], or specialized approaches not used elsewhere in the community [@Shakun}Nature2012,@Anchukaitis\emph{Tierney2012,@Marcott}Science2013,@Tierney2013,@Routson2018]. 
Extracting the relevant data from commonly-used age-modelling algorithms, creating time-uncertain ensembles, then reformatting those data for analysis in available tools typically requires the development of extensive custom codesets. 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Motivation}

GeoChronR is built to lower the barriers to broader adoption of these emerging methods.
It provides an easily-accessibly, open-source and extenisble software package of industry-standard and cutting-edge tools that provides users a single environment to create, analyse, and visualize time-uncertain data.
GeoChronR is designed around emerging standards in the paleogeosciences that connects users to growing libraries of standardized datasets formatted in the Linked PaleoData format [@LiPD] and [@neotoma].

\chapter*{Use cases \{\#use-cases\}}

We now illustrate the use of these tools on four use cases. The first example shows how to create age ensembles on different archives, and how to visualize the timing of abrupt events with appropriate uncertainty quantification. The second example shows how to quantify similarities in age-uncertain records. The third introduces the topic of age-uncertain calibrations, the fourth quantifies multivariate relationships using principal components analyses, and the fifth deal with spectral analysis. 

\section*{Creating an age ensemble}

A common first task when using geoChronR is to create an age ensemble, either because the user is developing a new record, or because the age ensemble data for the record they are interested is unavailable.
As described in section X.Y workflows for four published age quantification programs are integrated into geoChronR.
Bacon [@bacon], BChron [@parnell2008flexible], and OxCal [@ramsey2008deposition] are Bayesian age-deposition models that estimate posteriors on age-depth relationships with different assumptions and methodologies.
BAM [@BAM] was designed to probabilistically simulate counting uncertainty in banded archives, such as corals, ice cores, or varved sediments, but can also be used to simulate age uncertainty for any record, and is useful when the data or metadata required to calculate an age-depth model are unavailable.
All four methods are mostly simply used in geoChronR with a LiPD file that contains the chronological measurements, and the functions \texttt{runBacon(L)}, \texttt{runBchron(L)}, \texttt{runOxcal(L)} and \texttt{runBam(L)}.
These functions take LiPD objects as inputs, and return updated LiPD objects that include age-ensemble data generated by the respective software packages.
Typically, additional parameters are needed for to optimally run the algorithms.
When these parameters are not included, geoChronR will run in interactive mode, asking the user which variables and parameters they would like to model.
These parameter choices are printed to the screen during while the program runs, or are available later with the function \texttt{getLastVarString()}.
By specifying these parameters, age model creation can be scripted and will run in non-interactive mode.
In this use case, we'll use geoChronR and BChron [@parnell2008flexible] to calculate an age ensemble for the Hulu Cave \$delta\textasciicircum{}\{18\}\$O speleothem record [@hulu2001], and BAM [@BAM] to simulate age uncertainties for the GISP2 ice core \$delta\textasciicircum{}\{18\}\$O dataset [@alley].
The \texttt{plotChronEns(hulu)} function will plot an age-depth model and uncertainties derived from the age ensemble.

After an age ensemble has been added to a LiPD object, the user can visualize the ensemble timeseries using \texttt{plotTimeseriesEnsRibbons()} and \texttt{plotTimeseriesEnsLines()}.
GISP2 \$delta\textasciicircum{}\{18\}\$O is plotted with age uncertainty, using both functions, in figure x.

\section*{Correlation}

Now that the user has generated age ensembles for the two datasets, they're interested to see if a correlation between the two datasets is robust to the age uncertainty modeled here.
On multi-millennial timescales, the two datasets have similarities, and previous work has suggested that could events during the Last Glacial period, which are observed in the GISP2 record, can impact the Asian Monsoon and be observed is speleothem records such as the Hulu Cave dataset. (NM: add references here and flesh out background)
The \texttt{corEns()} function in geoChronR will calculate ensemble correlations across age-uncertain datasets, such as these.
\texttt{corEns()} will also sample across ensembles in the paleoData as well, if present.
Here we calculate correlations during the period of overlap in 500 yr steps, determining significance for each pair of ensemble members while accounting for autocorrelation.

The results show consistently negative correlations, although 15.21\% of the ensemble members are positive.
However, only 0.91\% are significant after accounting for serial autocorrelation.

In this use case, we demonstrate how a user could calculate and visualize and age-uncertain correlation between the Hulu speleothem \$delta\textasciicircum{}\{18\}mathrm\{O\}\$ record and the GISP2 ice core \$delta\textasciicircum{}\{18\}mathrm\{O\}\$ record. (Introduction about why a user might want to do an age uncertain correlation between Hulu and GISP2).

\section*{Age-uncertain Calibration}

A natural extension of ensemble correlation is ensemble regression.
Although there are use cases where regressing one age-uncertain variable onto another is called for, here we regress an age-uncertain paleoclimate proxy onto time-certain instrumental to develop a calibration-in-time.
For this use case, we reproduce the results of @Boldt:2015, where the authors calibrate a spectral reflectance measure of chlorophyll abundance to temperature in Northern Alaska.

\section*{Principle Component Analysis}

Thus far, the use cases have highlighted age-uncertain analyses of one or two sites, however quantifying the effects of age uncertainty can be even more impactful over large spatial datasets. 
Here we showcase how to use geoChronR to perform age-uncertain principle components analysis (PCA), also known as Monte Carlo Empirical Orthogonal Function (MCEOF) analysis, pioneered by @anchukaitis2013mceof.
In this example, we examine the Arctic 2k database [@McKayKaufman2014McKayKaufman2014].
